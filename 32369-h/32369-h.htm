<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Archibald Dundass</span> was a rich Jamaica planter,
whose estates were situated in one of the most delightful
regions in that garden of the West India
isles. His wife, an English lady, of great personal
attractions and highly connected, died when Helen,
their only child, had just entered her thirteenth year,
an age when, perhaps, a mother's counsel and tender
guidance is most required. When the news of Mrs.
Dundass's death reached her friends, they immediately
wrote, beseeching the bereaved husband to
come at once to England with his child, or if not expedient
for himself to leave Jamaica, that he would
at least suffer the little Helen to come to them; and
especially did they urge the plea that thereby he
would enable her to receive a more finished education
than could possibly be acquired upon the island.</p>

<p>This plea, to be sure, offered a strong inducement
to Mr. Dundass; but how could he school his heart to
this second bereavement. Helen possessed all her
mother's traits&mdash;her dark blue eyes&mdash;her golden hair
and skin of dazzling purity&mdash;the smile that played
around her dimpled mouth&mdash;her light airy step, were
all her mother's. Looking upon her thus in her
budding loveliness the Helen of his youth once more
moved before him. To yield her up he could not&mdash;and
therefore Mr. Dundass rejected the oft-repeated
entreaties of his English friends. Helen remained
in Jamaica. A governess was provided, and whatever
money could secure in the way of learning was
most freely expended.</p>

<p>Mr. Dundass possessed many noble traits of character,
yet pride was a very strong ingredient in his
composition leading him not unfrequently into errors
which his sober judgment condemned. Still he was
generally beloved, especially by his slaves, to whom
he was a kind, indulgent master. Knowing himself
to be one of the richest, if not <i>the</i> richest proprietor
upon the island, it was natural he should mark out
an alliance for his daughter commensurate with the
fortune her hand would bestow. When, therefore,
Helen, beaming and beautiful as the star of evening,
burst from the confinement of the school-room to
dazzle all eyes and move all hearts, what wonder
that pride and ambition swelled the heart of Mr.
Dundass. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love will venture in where it daur nae weel be seen;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and, unfortunately for the realization of those ambitious
dreams, a mutual love had already sprung up
between Helen and a young man without friends or
fortune, whom her father had received into favor,
and employed for some years in his counting-room.</p>

<p>To appeal to Mr. Dundass for his sanction to their
union Ward knew would be vain, and he therefore
prevailed upon the imprudent Helen to elope with
him, assuring her that her father's anger would be
but momentary, and that his great affection triumphing
over resentment, would compel him to forgive her
error, and open his arms to welcome her return.
But, unhappily, it was not so. There was no moving
the heart of Mr. Dundass to forgiveness. His anger
and resentment were as boundless as had been his
love. He refused to see his child, spurned her from
his door, and to all the numerous and penitent letters
she addressed him, gave no reply. The blow was,
indeed, a heavy one, coming from one so idolized;
his affections, as well as his long-cherished pride,
were crushed, and his resentment rose in proportion.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ward had removed to a distant
part of the island with his young and beautiful bride,
where he had obtained a situation which promised to
be lucrative. That he loved his young wife who
for his sake had renounced wealth, station, and a
father's love, cannot be doubted; but that he also
held a corner of his heart for the possessions she
might inherit, is also certain. His disappointment,
therefore, at the inflexibility of Mr. Dundass was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
extreme, and mingled with it a bitterness which, in
a short time, displayed itself toward his unoffending
wife, and in an irritability which, ere the end of a
twelvemonth, caused his employer to dismiss him
from his service. From that time the life of poor
Helen was most wretched, bitterly reaping in tears
and poverty the fruits of disobedience. From place
to place she followed her husband wherever he could
obtain employ, but of which his idle, dissolute habits
soon deprived him. A constitution naturally feeble
sunk under the inroads of dissipation. Ere three
years a wife Helen became a widow. Her situation
was now truly deplorable. Without money, without
friends, and thrown upon the cold charity of the
world ere yet she had reached her twentieth year.
For the sake of her innocent babe she resolved to
make one more appeal to the mercy of her father.</p>

<p>Over mountain ridges, through deep valleys&mdash;crossing
dense forests and treacherous rivulets&mdash;sometimes
on foot, sometimes indebted to the kindness
of some chance traveler for a few miles ride,
Helen at length drew near the home of her childhood,
and stole, unannounced, into the presence of her father.
The moment was propitious. Mr. Dundass had already
learned the death of his son-in-law, and the probable
destitution of his daughter. In those three years
alienation from his only child he had suffered much,
and untimely old age had silvered his temples and
worn deep furrows o'er his brow. Not all his wealth,
not all the goadings of disappointed ambition, nor
even the sting her ingratitude had left, could drive
her image from his heart, or check the still small
voice of conscience, which whispered that not even her
errors could excuse the harshness with which she had
been repulsed. The death of Ward seemed to unite
Helen once more to him. Over her misfortunes he
shed bitter tears; and although pride still rebelled
against the yearnings of his heart, and made him resolve
he would never more admit her to his presence,
yet even at the moment when she fell fainting and
exhausted at his feet, he was meditating some measures
by which he could place her and her little one
above want. Ah! pride, anger, enduring obstinacy,
where are ye now? There was a well of love in
that old man's heart whose depths ye had not yet
probed. One look at the sad, care-worn face of
Helen; one glance at the innocent babe pillowed
upon her breast, and that fount of love was unsealed.
The father took them to his breast and blessed them.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>A few years and Helen, more beautiful than ever,
again made her appearance in society, and again
Mr. Dundass cherished his darling dream of her
forming some high connection. Little Mildred, in
the meanwhile, having been sent to England under
the charge of a faithful nurse, to receive her education.</p>

<p>A second time, however, was Mr. Dundass doomed
to disappointment. The charming and attractive
young widow gave her hand to Mr. Donaldson, a
Scotch gentleman, whose only recommendation in
the eyes of Mr. Dundass was a showy exterior and
a superb set of teeth. He had known him for many
years, and had always regarded him as more shrewd
than honest, and one who, where his own interests
were concerned, would let no scruples of conscience
stand in the way of his advancement. He thought
him rich, but he had much rather he had been poor,
if able to boast a titled descent. The idea, therefore,
of this second marriage of his daughter gave him in
reality as little satisfaction as the first. His reluctant
consent was, however, at length obtained, and Helen
borne off a second time a bride from her father's
house.</p>

<p>The plantation of Mr. Donaldson was delightfully
located in a most lovely region of hill and dale,
sparkling with delicious rivulets, and sprinkled with
charming groves of the deep-tinted pimento, the
graceful palm, and magnificent cotton-trees, and the
air rife with the fragrance of the orange and citron
blossoms, through which, like winged jewels, glanced
birds of the most brilliant plumage. Whatever may
have been the errors which Mr. Dundass detected in
the moral character of Mr. Donaldson, he was a most
tender and devoted husband; and in this paradise to
which he had brought her, the happiness of Helen
seemed perfect. The Cascade, as Mr. Donaldson
had named his station, from the numerous little rills
and waterfalls in the neighborhood, was distant fifty
miles from Mount Dundass, yet the intercourse between
father and daughter continued uninterrupted
until the infirmities of age pressing upon Mr. Dundass,
rendered his visits to the Cascade less frequent,
and the cares of a growing family confining Mrs.
Donaldson more closely at home.</p>

<p>Helen was now the mother of several children,
charming, bright little girls, yet it was strange that
Mr. Dundass never seemed to regard them in the
same tender light he did Mildred Ward. Mr. Donaldson
had never seen Mildred, but already in his heart
he hated her. The partiality of the grandfather
rankled his inmost soul, for he saw plainly it would
interfere with the prospects of his own children.
Indeed, Mr. Dundass had already settled fifty thousand
dollars upon his granddaughter Mildred, asserting
also that at his death that sum should be doubled.
Mr. Donaldson possessed great influence over his
wife&mdash;his words to her were oracles&mdash;his wishes
laws. By degrees, therefore, he instilled into her
mind a jealousy against her absent child, mingled
with feelings of resentment toward her father, that, to
the exclusion of her little Grace and Anna, he should
have made her the object of his love and munificence.
This feeling once engendered Mr. Donaldson took
good care to keep alive. The poison worked slowly
but so secretly, that no doubt Helen herself would
have been shocked could she have read her own
heart and found that, instigated by jealousy, a mother's
tenderness for her first-born was fast turning to
bitterness.</p>

<p>In the meantime seventeen rosy summers had
flitted as some fairy dream over the head of Mildred,
when her grandfather, no longer able to resist his
desire of seeing her, urged her return to Jamaica.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>To merry England our story now takes us, that
we may trace a brief sketch of those scenes wherein
the days of Mildred had glided so happily away.</p>

<p>Norcross Hall, the ancestral domain of the late
Mrs. Dundass was situated in one of England's most
charming nooks, about forty miles from the great
metropolis. It was an ancient building, the main
part of which was said to have been erected in the
time of Elizabeth&mdash;but of this little of the original
structure remained. Its present occupant, Sir Hugh
Norcross, was the son of Mrs. Dundass's eldest
brother, and to his guardianship the little Mildred
had been consigned. In this charming family she
was treated with the utmost tenderness, receiving
the same education and sharing the same pursuits as
her little cousins, between whom and herself a lively
affection sprung up. Lady Norcross was a superior
woman, both of mind and heart; and under her
guidance and gentle teachings, which her every-day
life so beautifully exemplified, what wonder that the
little family growing up around her should prove all
that was good and lovely. Helen Norcross was
near the same age as Mildred, Rupert three years
her senior. It was not until the latter had reached
his fourteenth year that the three cousins were ever
separated, even for a single day; but now, Rupert
was sent to Eton, and the two girls were left to weep
and mourn his absence, or to study a thousand delightful
projects to welcome his return at the holydays.</p>

<p>What happy seasons those were when, released for
a time from the thraldom of college pursuits, Rupert
once more sprung in freedom through the haunts of
his childhood; the old walls rung with cheerful voices,
and every dell and dingle echoed to the merry music
of their happy hearts. And then, as each holyday
came round, what changes marked their progress.
The two little girls had become graceful, lovely women,
while Rupert from a school-boy had as suddenly
shot up into a tall, elegant young man.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh and his lady saw with pleasure the attachment
of the cousins; they already loved Mildred as
their daughter, and it was the nearest wish of their
hearts that in time the affection which now united
them might assume a more enduring form. As the
education of Mildred might now be considered completed,
and the object for which she had been sent to
them attained, they grew every day more and more
fearful that Mrs. Donaldson would claim her long
absent child. Mildred was too young when she left
Jamaica to have other than a faint recollection of
her mother; she could only remember the beautiful
blue eyes which used to meet hers so fondly, and
the long golden ringlets through which, as she nestled
in mamma's lap, she had played bo-peep with
an old gentleman in a high-backed elbow-chair.
Then she was so happy at Norcross Hall that when
her heart whispered to her, as it often did, of her
other dear mother in a far-off land, she could not but
reproach herself for not being more impatient for
the moment to arrive when she might again embrace
her. But now the time drew near when she must
bid farewell to this cherished spot.</p>

<p>April had smiled farewell in tears, and May with
her beauteous buds and blossoms danced over the
green earth. The streams welcomed her presence
with songs of glee, and the forests dressed in fresh
beauty opened their arms to greet her presence. It
was yet early morning, and to the uplifting of the
rosy curtain draping the couch of the day-god the
birds were singing a merry prelude, as two young
men stole softly around an angle of the old building,
and crept silently under the shadow of the wall, until
they stood beneath the windows of an apartment
whose inmates were probably buried in sleep, as
through the half-closed shutter the curtains appeared
still closely drawn.</p>

<p>"You see I have proved a true prophet, for the
girls still sleep," cried the taller of the two, laughing.
"Now fie upon their laziness this bright May morning&mdash;why
we should have been off to the dell an
hour since, to gather the flowers ere the sun kissed
away their freshness."</p>

<p>"Now I will warrant you, Rupert," replied the
other, "that while we stand here with 'dewy feet,'
maybe catching our deaths from this early exposure
of our delicate frames, the little jades are quietly
dreaming over the last new romance, or their first
ball&mdash;come, let us arouse them with a song!" and
dropping on one knee, the young man placed his
hand upon his heart, and lifting his eyes to the window
in the most languishing manner began:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Come, come to me, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come, love, arise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shame the bright stars<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the light of thine eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look out from thy lattice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O lady&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Very well sung, most tender swain&mdash;what a pity
Mildred and myself by our too early rising lost the
melting expression of those upturned orbs!" cried
Helen, issuing with her cousin from a thicket of
rose-bushes. "So you thought us still sleeping,
slanderers, when we have already brushed the dew
from the lawn, and look here," (showering down a
quantity of early violets,) "see what we stole from
Flora while you two were sleeping."</p>

<p>A few moments were spent in playful badinage,
and then the happy party strolled off in the direction
of the dell. But, alas! like many of our brightest
hopes this morn which dawned so blissfully was
destined to end in sorrow! Upon the return of the
party to the Hall, Sir Hugh with a sorrowful countenance
placed in the hands of Mildred a package of
letters. She grew pale as she read, and ere she had
finished burst into tears, and handing the package to
Sir Hugh fled to her chamber. Those letters contained
the mandate for her return to Jamaica. That
very week she must leave Norcross Hall, its beloved
inmates, and all the delightful scenes of her childhood,
and hasten to London, to join a family who
were about returning to the island, and to whose
charge her grandfather had consigned her.</p>

<p>The grief which filled all hearts at this dreaded
separation may easily be imagined. Rupert was
nearly crazy at the thought. He now felt how dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Mildred was to him, and that to part with her was
like rending soul and body. But certain that his love
would meet the sanction of his parents, knowing
how tenderly they regarded her, he hastened to make
known his feelings to them, and to entreat that he
might accompany Mildred to Jamaica, and demand
the consent of her friends to their union.</p>

<p>"No, my dear son," said Sir Hugh, "Mildred is
yet very young&mdash;of the world she knows little, and
it would be cruel to shackle her with ties which she
may in time be brought to abhor, nor would it be
doing justice to her friends to bind down her affections
to us alone. Leave her free, Rupert; if she
loves you, that love will not diminish by absence,
and I promise you that in due time you shall be
allowed to prosecute your suit in the presence of her
mother, and should you be so fortunate as to win a
bride so lovely, your parents' hearts will welcome
her with joy."</p>

<p>How coldly his father reasoned thought the ardent
young lover, but accustomed to yield all deference
to his wishes, he consented that Mildred should depart
without knowing how necessary her love was
to his happiness.</p>

<p>Both Sir Hugh and Rupert accompanied her to
London, and saw her safely on board her majesty's
ship the Essex, bound for Jamaica.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>Leaving Mildred to pursue her voyage we will
see what preparations were already making for her
return by Mr. Donaldson.</p>

<p>This gentleman was by no means as rich as many
supposed him to be. His plantations were valuable,
and located advantageously, but whether from mismanagement,
or from circumstances beyond his control,
for several years his affairs had become greatly
involved, and he had only been saved from absolute
ruin through the scheming friendship of a Spaniard
named Perozzi&mdash;a man whose cunning was as deep
as his own, and who by advancing large sums from
time to time, only sought to entangle his victim in
such a snare as should secure him in the end his
valuable possessions. Pride prevented Mr. Donaldson
from applying to Mr. Dundass&mdash;every year matters
grew worse, until finally he felt himself to be
completely in the power of Perozzi, who had even
begun to threaten loudly, and talk of distraining. It
was at this critical juncture that Mr. Dundass declared
his intention of sending for Mildred Ward.
A project now suddenly suggested itself to Mr. Donaldson
which promised to relieve him from his difficulties,
and which he seized upon in his selfishness
with as little conscience as the highwayman who
robs you of life in order to obtain your purse.</p>

<p>Mounting his mule he one morning rode over to
the "Pen" of Perozzi, some few miles farther down
the valley. He was received rather coolly.</p>

<p>"Your timely visit has saved me a ride this morning,
Donaldson," said the Spaniard. "I have an
imperative necessity for my money, or at least for a
part of it."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, the very thing I have come to
talk about!" said Donaldson.</p>

<p>"<i>Corambre&mdash;to talk about!</i> It must be something
more than talk&mdash;words will not answer my
purpose," replied Perozzi, his sharp black eye glittering
with hate. "I tell you money I must have&mdash;money
I will have, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good God, Perozzi, don't drive me to desperation.
You know I cannot pay you a single piastre!
Only wait until I receive my return sales from England,
and I swear to you you shall receive your last
farthing!"</p>

<p>"Holy Mother Mary! your return sales from England!"
exclaimed the other, in a tone of cutting sarcasm.
"In what manner of vessel must those same
returns be coming, for, if my memory serves me,
Columbus discovered a new world in less time than
this same richly-freighted <i>caravela</i> has been crossing
the Atlantic&mdash;this has been your answer for twice a
twelvemonth. And now," he continued, suddenly
altering his tone, and striding to the side of his victim,
"there must be an end of this&mdash;either pay me what
you owe me, or give me a quit claim to the Cascade,
for which you have already received from me more
than its value."</p>

<p>"By heavens, Perozzi!" cried Mr. Donaldson,
turning pale with anger and mortification, "this is
more than I can bear even from you; but come," he
added, suddenly forcing a laugh, "it was to see you
upon a more pleasing errand I came here."</p>

<p>"<i>Corambre!</i>" whistled through the teeth of the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Perozzi; what would you say if I could
this moment promise to place you in possession of
one hundred thousand dollars and&mdash;a wife?"</p>

<p>"Say! why that the Devil helped you to cajole,
and then deserted you at the pinch, as he always
does!" replied Perozzi.</p>

<p>"No cajolery about it, as you shall find," answered
Mr. Donaldson. "But come, let us sit&mdash;by your leave
I'll taste your wine; your health, signor, and" (turning
out a second glass) "here is another to Madame
Perozzi&mdash;ha-ha-ha! There&mdash;now," said he, setting
down his glass with a force which nearly shivered
it, "listen to me. You know that Mrs. Donaldson,
by her first husband, had one daughter, Mildred
Ward, who is at this moment on her return from
England, whither she was sent at an early age for
her education. She is now, by the bye, seventeen,
and, as report informs us, extremely beautiful and
accomplished. Now what think you, Perozzi, of the
charming Mildred for a wife?"</p>

<p>"I want money&mdash;no wife!" moodily replied Perozzi,
draining a third glass.</p>

<p>"Precisely&mdash;money," answered the other; "and
that is what the fair hand of Mildred tenders you."</p>

<p>"One hundred thousand dollars, did you say,
Donaldson?" said the Spaniard, with a searching
gaze.</p>

<p>"I did. Fifty thousand with the wedding-ring,
and the balance when the old man, her grandfather,
dies."</p>

<p>Excellent, by the Virgin!&mdash;ha-ha-ha! No one can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
dispute your skill in diplomacy; but methinks it
would be well to know by what method you propose
to bring about a "consummation so devoutly to be
wished," said Perozzi, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me; only act with me, and Mildred
Ward becomes your wife just so certain as I now
drink to you&mdash;your health, signor."</p>

<p>"And, pray, allow me to ask," said Perozzi, "what
benefit you expect to reap from such unparalleled
generosity&mdash;it cannot surely be out of pure love to
me that you thus</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Buckle fortune on my back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear her burthen whether I will or no!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You are right," answered Mr. Donaldson, dropping
the servile tone in which he had before spoken,
"you are right&mdash;it is from no love to you; my object
is this. You know as well as I do the utter impracticability
of my refunding any part of the money I
owe you at present. True, you may seize my estates,
but this I think you will hardly do in preference to
the plan I propose; it would be at best but a vexatious
affair, while by accepting my proposition you secure
not only an equivalent for your debt, but also the
hand of a charming young girl."</p>

<p>"Well, well, to the point," interrupted the
Spaniard, impatiently.</p>

<p>"It is simply this; give me your written promise
to release me from all obligation, return me whatever
notes you hold against me, and I on my part
pledge to you the hand and fortune of my step-daughter."</p>

<p>Perozzi remained for some moments in deep revery,
as if studying the feasibility of the proposed plan.
"I have half a mind to try it," he mused; "it may
do&mdash;the connection will be a good one. Old Dundass
is as rich as a Jew, and a man of great influence;
while on the other hand, should the project fail, I
shall be no worse off than now, unless an earthquake
should swallow up the estates from my grasp."</p>

<p>"There is one contingency which seems to have
entirely escaped your forecast," he exclaimed aloud,
turning to Mr. Donaldson, "the lady may not be of
your way of thinking&mdash;she may prove refractory."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I may not fancy her."</p>

<p>"Nor the money?" added Mr. Donaldson, with a
meaning smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, there, I grant, you have me. Well, well, I
am willing to talk the matter over with you a little
more freely. Miss Ward is handsome, you say?"</p>

<p>"As a Houri."</p>

<p>"And young?"</p>

<p>"Scarce seventeen."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;now to business."</p>

<p>But we have already entered into sufficient detail
of the conversation of these two men to show the
reader in what peril poor Mildred stood from their
machinations. It is enough to say that ere they
parted, Perozzi pledged his word that, should their
plot succeed, he would, on his marriage-day, place
in the hands of Mr. Donaldson a quit claim to every
demand he held against him.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<p>How beautiful was Mildred as she sprung to meet
the embrace of her old grandfather; and how fondly
did the old man gaze upon his recovered treasure,
almost incredulous that this lovely girl could be the
same little pet, whose infantine gambols and artless
caresses time had not been able to efface from his
mind.</p>

<p>The style of Mildred's beauty was, indeed, most
captivating and piquant. To a form of perfect symmetry
and airy grace was added a countenance
beaming with intellect and vivacity. Her complexion
was of the same dazzling fairness as her
mother's, but her eyes were of a deep-gray, sparkling
beneath the most delicately penciled brows, and her
hair of that dark, glossy chestnut, flecked as it were
with sunbeams, whose peculiar tint painters so much
love to catch. A small, rosy mouth, and white, regular
teeth, which in her innocent vivacity were
often displayed, completes the picture of Mildred's
charms.</p>

<p>After spending a few days at Mount Dundass she
took leave of her grandfather, and under the escort
of Mr. Donaldson, who had hastened thither for the
purpose, departed for the Cascade, impatient to behold
her mother, in whose love she trusted to find
a recompense for the pain which parting with her dear
friends at Norcross Hall had caused. And for a few
weeks all went happily. The sight of her innocent,
beautiful child banished for a time from the heart of
Mrs. Donaldson that unnatural jealousy her husband
had awakened. Mr. Donaldson, for his own selfish
purposes, strove by every attention and kindness to
win her esteem and confidence, while Mildred on her
part delighted with and reciprocating her mother's
affection, gratified by the interest her step-father expressed
for her, and perfectly enchanted with the
novel and beautiful scenery, threw off all her sadness&mdash;linking
the past with the present, not regretful or
sorrowful, but as one continued scene of love and
happiness, for which her heart rose in gratitude to
her Maker that he had conferred upon her so many
rich blessings.</p>

<p>How often did she wish that Rupert and Helen
could share with her this West India paradise.
The climate so bland and delicious&mdash;soft, balmy
airs by day, and nights of unclouded loveliness;
the beautiful undulating scenery of hill and valley
stretching far away into the dim haze of ocean&mdash;hills
from whose summits towered the magnificent
cabbage-palm, its immense plume-like leaves waving
like the crest of some gigantic warrior above the
band of palms crowding around, bending their graceful
heads to this their chief; valleys of luxuriant beauty,
studded with groves of the aromatic pimento, whose
pure white blossoms seem like snow-flakes just
fallen amid their dark, glossy foliage, while at intervals
clumps of magnolia, resting on a carpet of
bright verdure sprinkled with flowers, and their trunks
garlanded with the gay passa-flora, arrested the eye.
From those beautiful hill-sides silvery cascades came
leaping and dancing down into the rich valleys, then
twining their lovely arms through this charming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
landscape, as if they would fain bear off its beauties
to the broad ocean, whither they are gliding.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you may be sure, Perozzi made
his appearance at the Cascade, where, under some
slight pretext, he soon became almost domesticated,
merely riding over to the Pen at intervals of two or
three days. To Mildred there was something extremely
repulsive in his appearance, and she could
not but feel amazed at the influence he seemed to
exercise over her parents, and the deference with
which they treated him. She little dreamed of the
power he would soon exert against her happiness&mdash;just
as over those luxuriant valleys, whose smiling
beauty I have but imperfectly sketched, the whirl-wind
comes rushing in terrible might, scattering ruin
and devastation around, did the tempest burst over
the head of Mildred, changing all the brightness of
her young life to darkness. Perozzi needed no other
impetus than the sight of Mildred's beauty to render
him as eager to push forward the plot in agitation as
Mr. Donaldson, and in accordance his attentions to
her assumed a direct and positive form. She, however,
had not the most remote suspicion of his intentions.
How great, then, was her surprise when one
day Perozzi made her a formal offer of his hand,
assuring her at the same time that he did so with
the consent and approbation of her parents and her
grandfather. Mildred could hardly credit her senses,
that Perozzi, a man as old as her step-father, should
think of a mere child like herself for a wife, seemed
very strange, but that her friends should also approve
of such a match, stranger still.</p>

<p>"My dearest Mildred, what have you done!" cried
Mrs. Donaldson, meeting her daughter a few hours
after. "Can it be possible you have refused Signor
Perozzi?"</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, you surely do not think I could do
otherwise than refuse him!" replied Mildred, surprised
at her mother's manner.</p>

<p>"And why not, Mildred? Would it not be a most
eligible match for you&mdash;why he is not only very rich,
but will probably soon succeed to a title."</p>

<p>"Riches and titles can never make happiness,
mamma."</p>

<p>"But they conduce greatly to its maintainance,
Mildred."</p>

<p>"O, no, mamma, not if attached to such a disagreeable
person as the signor."</p>

<p>"Disagreeable! Mildred, you surprise me&mdash;pray
what can be your objections?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, they are so numerous, that the repetition
would only be tiresome," replied Mildred, smiling.
"But you are surely laughing at me; you did not
really suppose, now did you, that I could love such
a man?"</p>

<p>"I did suppose you had more sense, Mildred, than
to refuse him," replied Mrs. Donaldson. "I can
only say your decision has deeply grieved both Mr.
Donaldson and myself; yet we regret it more for the
disappointment it will cause your grandfather, for to
see you the wife of Perozzi has long been his most
cherished wish."</p>

<p>"Can it be!" cried Mildred. "Can it be that my
grandfather, my kind grandfather, would have me
marry Perozzi&mdash;is it so, mamma?"</p>

<p>"It is, Mildred."</p>

<p>"Now, indeed, am I most unhappy," cried
Mildred, bursting into tears, "for it can never,
never be!"</p>

<p>"My sweet child, I am sorry to see you so
grieved!" said Mrs. Donaldson. "It must be
painful, I know, for you to distress your excellent
old grandfather, who loves you so truly, and has
ever treated you with such generosity; but perhaps
your decision has been too hasty&mdash;it is not too late;
reconsider the subject, Mildred, and perhaps you will
conclude differently."</p>

<p>"No, mamma, my resolution is unalterable!"</p>

<p>"Let me at least soften your refusal to poor Perozzi&mdash;indeed,
he is quite overwhelmed with despair; let
me bid him hope that in time you may be brought to
listen more favorably to his suit."</p>

<p>"O, not for worlds, mamma&mdash;not for worlds!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear, you are strangely agitated.
There, go&mdash;retire to your chamber, and compose
yourself, my love;" and affectionately kissing her
daughter, Mrs. Donaldson repaired to the library,
where her husband and Perozzi were awaiting the
result of this interview.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Donaldson forgotten her own youth?</p>

<p>From that day Mildred was the object of ceaseless
persecution. Go where she would, there was Perozzi
ever at her side, to annoy her with his odious attentions;
walking or riding, he intruded himself upon
her; no room in the house seemed sacred from his
approach; and even when she retired to her own
apartment, he either stationed himself beneath her
window, or stood at her door, ready to greet her
with his hateful smile as she issued forth. Constantly,
too, was he urging his suit, while her repeated
refusals, her cold words, and still colder looks,
might as well have been spent upon a rock&mdash;for a
rock could not be more impressionless to their meaning.
The persecution she underwent from the odious
Perozzi, had, perhaps, revealed to her the true nature
of her regard for Rupert, and in so doing, brought
also the pleasing consciousness that she was beloved
even as she loved him. How aggravating, then, her
situation. Daily her life grew more wretched, nor
had she even the consolation of sympathy. With a
yearning heart did she now recall the happy days at
Norcross Hall, rendered by contrast still more dear.
"O!" she cried, in her anguish, "could I but once
more rest in their loving arms, what power could
tear me thence! Dearest Helen! Dearest Rupert,
come to me! O, hasten thither and rescue me from
this horrible thraldom!"</p>

<p>But months passed in sorrow; there came no letters
from England&mdash;nothing to cheer up her fainting heart,
and finally, Mildred, the once gay, happy Mildred,
sunk into a state of utter despondency.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<p>"<i>Hist&mdash;hist</i>, Pedro!" and a tall, swarthy Creole,
obeying the finger of Perozzi, glided stealthily behind
a large tree, where stood the Spaniard, both screened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
from observation by the thick drapery of ferns and
parasitic plants clinging around its trunk. Eyeing
the man keenly, Perozzi said, in a low tone,</p>

<p>"Hark-ye, Pedro! I have a job for you; here are
thirty pistoles as an earnest, and when it is finished,
you shall receive thirty more."</p>

<p>"By St. Jago, signor! I am ready&mdash;what is it?
<i>This?</i>" touching the handle of his knife.</p>

<p>"<i>Corambre</i>, knave! No. Listen to me. Do you
see yonder mansion, with the green verandas stretching
itself out on the hill-side like an anaconda
at play?"</p>

<p>"The Scotchman's&mdash;Donaldson's?"</p>

<p>"The same. Now look, and tell me what you
see at the open jalousie on the right, that is, if you
can see through the heavy screen of jessamines
which droop over it."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! I have eyes at any time for a pretty
girl, signor; she is an angel, that fair English girl!"</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;you know her, then. Now do you
remember the thick pimento walk between this and
the hospital?"</p>

<p>"Si, signor."</p>

<p>"Now, Pedro, hasten thither, and conceal yourself.
This fair Signora will soon pass that way.
Now mind me, knave, when she reaches the middle
of the grove, do you rush suddenly upon her&mdash;seize
her in your arms, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho-ho! a pleasant job, signor!"</p>

<p>"Peace, knave! Seize her, I tell you, and draw
your knife, as if about to plunge it in her white
bosom. Now, mark me, at that moment I rush upon
you and rescue the lady&mdash;do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Si, signor; but will your honor please to remember
I am but flesh and blood&mdash;don't strike more
than skin deep, signor."</p>

<p>"Tush, knave! and remember&mdash;no violence; by
the Holy Mother! if you so much as breathe upon a
hair of her head, you taste my dagger!"</p>

<p>"Ho-ho, signor! methinks to snatch a kiss from
her sweet lips would be worth more than a thousand
pistoles."</p>

<p>"Villain, to your work!"</p>

<p>"Ho-ho! a pleasant job, signor&mdash;a pleasant job!"
And with a hideous leer, the lesser villain parted
from the greater, and concealing himself within the
deep shadows of the grove, awaited the coming of
Mildred.</p>

<p>It was not long ere, little suspecting the terrible
scene which she was to encounter, Mildred set forth
<i>en route</i> to the hospital, to visit an old faithful female
slave. This was a favorite walk, and soothed by the
quiet of the scene, she lingered long in its delightful
depths. As her foot pressed the summit of a gentle
slope, enameled with many-colored flowers, and
over which frown the blood-tinged foliage of a stately
mahogany-tree, pendent garlands of the passion-flower,
and delicate white jasmine swung in the soft
breeze, she paused for a moment, as if to prolong
this happy reprieve from the presence of the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the wretch, Pedro, sprung in her path,
and while with one hand he seized the trembling
girl, with the other he drew his stiletto, and muttering
a horrible oath, raised it as if about to strike at her
innocent bosom. Mildred did not scream, she did
not faint, but he eyes closed, and all power of speech
and motion seemed paralized. But the threatened
blow was arrested; a violent struggle ensued, during
which she was clasped still more tightly to the breast
of the ruffian, who seemed to be defending himself
from some superior arm. Oaths and curses mingled
with the clash of weapons; she was dragged, as it
were, several paces through the grove, and then,
after another struggle, she felt the arm of the assassin
relax its grasp&mdash;she was caught to the breast of her
deliverer, and then placed gently on the soft turf.</p>

<p>"Mildred&mdash;my angel&mdash;my life&mdash;O, speak to me!"</p>

<p><i>That voice!</i> Mildred knew its hateful tones; and
a cold shudder crept through her frame, as if some
venomous reptile had touched her, as she felt the
villains lips press her brow. Recoiling, she slowly
opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Perozzi, "you are restored
to me. Holy Virgin! can it be&mdash;so near death,
and yet living and unhurt, I now hold you in my
arms! O, blessed moment, when love guided me
hither!"</p>

<p>"I owe you my life, signor," said Mildred,
freeing herself from his embrace, "but it is a thankless
boon; methinks death would have been sweeter!
Leave me&mdash;I am better&mdash;I am well&mdash;leave me,
signor!"</p>

<p>"Sweet angel! leave thee&mdash;leave thee thus exposed
to new dangers! No&mdash;lean on me, my beloved&mdash;let
me guide your trembling steps!" and he
passed his arm around her.</p>

<p>"Away!" cried Mildred, springing from him.
"Away! touch me not! Monster&mdash;fiend! I hate
you! Begone from my sight forever, or, in mercy,
kill me!"</p>

<p>Perozzi became livid with rage, and his eye-balls
gleamed like fire in the deepening shadows, as
they rested on Mildred, never more beautiful than
as she now stood before him in all the majesty of
outraged purity. But masking the hell in his heart
with a well-feigned air of desperation, he fell on his
knees before her.</p>

<p>"Would that the assassin's knife had reached my
heart!" he exclaimed. "Better for me to die than
endure your scorn. Yes, <i>die</i>! By heavens! why
not end this miserable existence&mdash;here&mdash;yes, here, at
your feet, cruel Mildred! <i>It shall be done!</i>" and
drawing a pistol from his breast, he placed the
muzzle to his temple.</p>

<p>"Hold&mdash;hold&mdash;for God's sake, miserable man,
hold!" shrieked Mildred, springing forward.</p>

<p>It was too late&mdash;the pistol exploded.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!" shouted Perozzi, wiping his blackened
brows, "that was well done!" And raising
the now senseless girl in his arms he bore her to the
house.</p>

<p>When, after a long and death-like swoon, Mildred
opened her eyes they rested upon the anxious countenances
of her mother and Mr. Donaldson bending
over her couch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where am I?" she cried, starting up wildly&mdash;"how
came I here&mdash;what has happened? Ah, now
I remember&mdash;or was it some dreadful dream?" She
pressed her hand to her forehead&mdash;"no, no, it was
no dream&mdash;tell me," she added, with a convulsive
shudder, closing her eyes as if to shut out some horrible
vision, "is he dead&mdash;is Perozzi dead?"</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my dear Mildred," replied
Mrs. Donaldson, "he lives&mdash;fortunately the ball but
slightly grazed his temple&mdash;yet, my child, such is
his despair&mdash;to such a state of frenzy has your cruelty
brought him, that we dare not trust him alone even
for a moment, lest he once more attempt to end his
misery by self-destruction."</p>

<p>A heart-rending groan was the poor girl's only
answer.</p>

<p>"Mildred, my daughter," said Mr. Donaldson, "I
had decided to say no more to you upon a subject so
painful, but duty to my friend compels me to make
one more appeal to your compassion. Can I stand
calmly by and witness the wreck which despair has
wrought in that beloved friend&mdash;can I behold him
resolutely rushing upon death to end his misery and
not speak! O, Mildred," falling on his knees, "save
him&mdash;for you can&mdash;Mildred, behold me thus imploring
your pity for Perozzi!"</p>

<p>Mildred burst into tears, and placed her hand
within that of Mr. Donaldson.</p>

<p>"You will relent, my sweet child, will you not?"
said her mother, throwing her arms around her&mdash;"yes,
you will, and make us all happy&mdash;see," she
added, drawing a letter from her bosom, "here is a
letter from my beloved father&mdash;let his words plead
with ours&mdash;shall I read?" Mildred assented, and
breaking the seal Mrs. Donaldson continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Mildred</span>,&mdash;You have refused compliance with
the fondest wish of my heart&mdash;you have obstinately
cast from you the man of all others I wished to see
your husband! Henceforth I renounce you. I loved
you, my child, (as I now for the last time call you,)
I have loved you from your infancy&mdash;to you I looked
as my greatest earthly blessing&mdash;but it is all over&mdash;we
never meet again! Yet, cruel, ungrateful girl,
I will not doom you to a life of hardship and dependence.
The fortune settled upon you is still yours.
Take it, Mildred, and enjoy it if you can, knowing
that you have broken the heart of your old doting
grandfather,</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Archibald Dundass</span>."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Donaldson concluded, Mildred sobbed
aloud. These reproaches, mingled with so much
kindness, almost broke her heart.</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," said she, extending her
trembling hand, and once more she tearfully perused
it, while a glance of triumph was exchanged between
husband and wife. The look of agony which Mildred
cast upon them as she finished reading would
have melted a heart of stone. Mrs. Donaldson burst
into tears, and even the lip of her husband quivered
with agitation.</p>

<p>"My God, pity me!" cried Mildred, clasping her
hands and raising her eyes to heaven. Once more
she turned them on her mother. "Mother, do not
weep&mdash;<i>I&mdash;O God&mdash;I&mdash;consent</i>!" And as if with
those dreadful words her pure spirit had fled, she fell
back cold and rigid as marble upon the pillow.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<p>Let the silence of despair rest upon the sufferings
of the unhappy Mildred after those fatal words had
passed her lips.</p>

<p>Among other artful devices agreed upon between
Mr. Donaldson and Perozzi, previous to Mildred's
return, was that of keeping her entirely secluded
from society, lest some other suitor might wrest the
hand of the doomed girl from him. But now that a
consent to their infernal measures had been torn
from her, it was resolved that a magnificent <i>f&ecirc;te</i>
should mark the <i>d&eacute;but</i> of the affianced bride. The
evening previous to the wedding was the time fixed
upon for this important event, and accordingly invitations
were immediately issued for a grand <i>bal
masqu&eacute;</i>, including the governor's family, together
with all the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the island.</p>

<p>For weeks all was hurry and confusion at the Cascade&mdash;artisans
of many trades were busily engaged
pulling down and putting up&mdash;the drawing-rooms&mdash;the
halls&mdash;verandas, all newly decorated&mdash;in fact,
the whole establishment, through the purse of Perozzi
and the good taste of Mrs. Donaldson, completely
revolutionized. Mildred in the meanwhile remained
in strict seclusion in her apartment, unless dragged
thence by the importunities of the Spaniard, so sad,
so perfectly overwhelmed with the wretchedness of
her lot, that it seemed most probable death might
claim the young bride ere the day of sacrifice came.
In vain her mother strove to interest her in the gay
proceedings&mdash;entreating she would at least choose a
costume for her expected <i>d&eacute;but</i>.</p>

<p>"Do with me as you will, mother," Mildred would
reply, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>In the sleeping-room of Mrs. Donaldson there
hung a portrait of a beautiful Turkish maiden. This
picture was a favorite with Mildred, and it occurred
to Mrs. Donaldson that a similar costume would
well become the style of her daughter's beauty. A
careful examination of her own and Mildred's ward-robe
convinced her the thing could be done, and she
set herself diligently to prepare the dress&mdash;Mildred
passively obeying her directions.</p>

<p>At length all was finished, and in its swift course
Time brought round the appointed evening for the
<i>d&eacute;but</i> of the wretched Mildred, so soon to become a
more wretched wife. At an early hour those guests
who resided at a distance began to arrive, and after
partaking of the grateful refreshments provided for
them were conducted to their dressing-rooms, to prepare
for the festivities of the evening&mdash;all being expected
to appear <i>en masqu&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donaldson, the still handsome mistress of the
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, wore a splendid dress of the tartan, in compliment
to the Scottish tastes of her husband, who himself
appeared in the costume of a Highland Chief,
and had already entered the drawing-room, in readiness
to welcome the gay throng. The victim, too,
was ready. Passive as a lamb in the hands of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
destroyer, she had suffered her mother and her maid
to array her, and now sat like some marbled image,
awaiting the coming of Perozzi to lead her forth.</p>

<p>How lovely she was, nor yet casting one look to
the mirror wherein her exquisite form and beautiful
face were reflected. The robe her mother had chosen
was the same as the picture, of a pale rose color,
floating like a summer cloud around her lovely person,
and confined to her waist by a broad girdle of
white satin, wrought with gold and clasped by a
superb diamond. The sleeves of the same airy fabric
as the caftan were long and loose, revealing in their
transparency the fine contour of her snowy arm, and
were ornamented upon the shoulders and around
the graceful fold of the outer edge with rich embroidery
seeded with pearls. The caftan was slightly
open at the bust, displaying an under vest of thin
white gauze gathered in maidenly modesty over her
lovely bosom, and fastened by a magnificent cluster
of diamonds and rubies. A <i>talpec</i>, or head-dress, of
white velvet, around which were wound two rows
of the finest pearls, was placed low on her pale
brow, from which her beautiful hair fell in long
natural ringlets, looped here and there with sprigs of
the white jasmine and orange buds.</p>

<p>Gently the wind swayed the orange boughs, and
creeping through the flowery links of the jessamine
and passa-flora, kissed the pale cheek of Mildred as
she sat there in her misery&mdash;twilight stole on with
saddened step, and from out the cloudless heavens
one by one the stars looked down upon her wretchedness.
Then over the distant mountains rose up
the full-orbed moon, bathing their summits with gladness
and flooding the valleys with calm and holy
light. On she came, majestic and serene, o'er her
glorious path, and as her mild beams quivered
through the thick clustering blossoms around the
window they touched the heart of Mildred as the
smile of angels. Throwing open the jalousie she
stepped into the veranda, and leaning over the balustrade
gazed upon the peaceful landscape stretching
before her in all the chastened loveliness of the
moonlight.</p>

<p>There was something in the scene which brought
with it the "light of other days" to her sad heart.
For a few brief moments she was happy&mdash;present
sorrows lost themselves in past pleasures. Once
more upon the ivy-clad battlements of Norcross Hall
she was standing with Helen and Rupert, while the
scene upon which the moon looked down identified
itself with the woods and dells of that beloved spot.
Her bright dream was brief&mdash;the voice of Perozzi in
loud and angry altercation with some one awoke her
too rudely to her misery.</p>

<p>"O, Rupert!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands
in agony as she turned to re-enter her chamber&mdash;"Rupert,
farewell&mdash;farewell forever!"</p>

<p>"Dearest Mildred!" cried a voice whose tones
leaped into her heart with a strange thrill of joy&mdash;"dearest
Mildred!"</p>

<p>Did she still dream&mdash;or was it indeed Rupert to
whose breast she was now folded with a bliss too
great for words!</p>

<p>"Thank God, Rupert, you have come!" cried
Mildred.</p>

<p>"Mildred," said Rupert, (for it was indeed Rupert,)
"what mean these tears? Are you not happy&mdash;this
marriage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;h!" shrieked Mildred, clinging to him as
though the basilisk hand of Perozzi were already
upon her, "<i>save me&mdash;save me</i>, Rupert!"</p>

<p>"<i>Save</i> you! dearest, beloved Mildred&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell
me quick&mdash;this marriage&mdash;is it not your own
choice?"</p>

<p>"O no, no, no!" sobbed Mildred.</p>

<p>"Then no power on earth shall compel you to it!
You are mine&mdash;mine, dearest Mildred!" and clasping
her once more in his arms, Rupert kissed the
tears from her beautiful eyes, as full of hope and
love they met his beaming gaze.</p>

<p>"But my grandfather!" she cried, starting up.</p>

<p>"He is here, dear girl."</p>

<p>"Here! then lead me to him quickly&mdash;let me implore
him to have pity upon me!"</p>

<p>The arrival of Mr. Dundass upon the scene was
wholly unlooked for by Mr. Donaldson&mdash;need we
say as wholly unwelcome. Guilt and fear paled his
cheek and almost palsied his tongue as his lips feigned
a welcome&mdash;nor was Perozzi less moved. To define
the feelings of Mrs. Donaldson would be difficult.
Her love for her daughter had been held in complete
subjugation to the will of her husband, and while she
grieved deeply for the sorrows heaped upon her, her
love and fear of Mr. Donaldson, and her knowledge
of his pecuniary distress caused her at the same time
to exert all her influence to rivet the chain around
poor Mildred&mdash;so strange is human nature! What
then was to be the result of her father's unexpected
visit&mdash;was it freedom for Mildred&mdash;was it to heap
disgrace upon her husband?</p>

<p>In the mean time Mr. Dundass had been shown to
a private room in a remote wing of the building,
while Mr. Donaldson and Perozzi were already planning
new schemes. They resolved that Mildred
should be kept in ignorance of her grandfather's
arrival as long as possible&mdash;of Rupert's they themselves
knew nothing&mdash;and that on no account should
she be allowed to speak with him privately. The
marriage should take place at an early hour the following
morning&mdash;<i>that</i> consummated they would defy
even the devil himself!</p>

<p>Mr. Dundass was sitting sad and sorrowful in the
apartment to which he had been conducted, for this
marriage filled him with grief, wondering that Mildred
did not appear to welcome him, or that Rupert
did not return, when the door suddenly opened and
Mildred rushed in, and falling at his feet exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O dearest, dearest grandfather, pity me&mdash;O sacrifice
me not to Perozzi!"</p>

<p>"Sacrifice you, my darling child! Come to my
arms&mdash;what mean you&mdash;<i>sacrifice</i>&mdash;I thought it was
your happiness I was securing by consenting to your
union."</p>

<p>"<i>Happiness!</i> O grandfather&mdash;rather my misery!"</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" exclaimed Mr. Dundass.
"There must be treachery somewhere! God knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
how it has grieved my heart to think of your union
with that man&mdash;I know him to be a villain, and when
repeatedly urged to consent to the marriage, I as
repeatedly refused, until your own letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> letter&mdash;good heavens!" exclaimed Mildred.</p>

<p>"Written in the most moving language, at length
won my reluctant consent!"</p>

<p>All was now explained, and the villainy of Mr.
Donaldson and his coadjutor made clear.</p>

<p>"Courage, courage, my darling," said Mr. Dundass,
"come with me. Come, Rupert, I will 'beard
the lion in his den,' and make known this infamous
plot&mdash;come."</p>

<p>"My mother&mdash;spare <i>her</i>, dear grandfather&mdash;forgive
them all&mdash;I am happy now&mdash;let us not mar the
pleasure of the guests," interceded Mildred.</p>

<p>"You say right, my child&mdash;to-morrow will be soon
enough. But come with me, children&mdash;let us join
the gay assembly&mdash;nay, fear not, Mildred. Perozzi,
the villain, he shall not dare even to look upon you!"</p>

<p>Now strains of delicious music filled the air&mdash;lights
gleamed&mdash;jewels flashed&mdash;feathers waved, and on
every side the merry laugh and gay badinage met
the ear from prince and beggar&mdash;wild roving gipsy
and sombre nun&mdash;knights in armor&mdash;minstrels&mdash;flower-girls&mdash;jugglers
and staid Quakers, as in confused
<i>m&eacute;l&eacute;e</i> they swept through the rooms&mdash;yet all
stood aside in silent admiration as the lovely Mildred
Ward in her graceful Turkish costume, her
face beaming with happiness, entered the saloon
leaning on the arm of her gray-haired sire.</p>

<p>Muttering curses through his closed visor, Perozzi
(who was dressed as a knight of Old Castile) hastily
left the scene. He had sought Mildred in her chamber&mdash;she
was not there, and well did his guilty fears
surmise where she might be found. One glance at
her speaking countenance was enough. He saw in
a moment all was over&mdash;that the fiendish plot so
near consummation was betrayed! With terrible
oaths he mounted his mule, and plunging his spurs
rowel-deep into the sides of the poor beast rushed,
armed as he was, like some terrible demon through
the peaceful moon-lit vale until he reached the Pen&mdash;vowing
that on the morrow he would seize at once
with the grip of a harpy upon the estates of Mr.
Donaldson.</p>

<p>But here, too, he was foiled! Mr. Donaldson, it
is true, did not deserve so much mercy, but when,
like a penitent, he came before Mr. Dundass and
confessed his crime, the heart of the old man was
moved to pity. He generously advanced the necessary
funds, and wrenched the Cascade from the
clutches of Perozzi. Touched by such unmerited
goodness and generosity, Mr. Donaldson resolved to
become a better man, and to repair by his future
conduct the errors of the past.</p>

<p>At Mount Dundass, whither the whole family accompanied
its venerable proprietor, Rupert received
the hand of the happy Mildred, and after the death of
Mr. Dundass, which took place only a few months
later, took his beautiful young bride to England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the last summer, Mary mine, I was one
of a party of friends, who, tired of the bustle and
confusion of the busy city, resolved to lay aside
business and all other engagements, for the brief
space of one day, which was to be devoted to a
picknick in some retired country location. The destined
spot for our intended <i>f&ecirc;te</i> was, after considerable
consultation, at length decided upon, and we
unanimously agreed to spend the day in a pleasant
woods in the neighborhood of New Brighton.</p>

<p>It was upon a balmy June morning, when, with
light hearts, but heavier baskets, laden with provisions,
sun-bonnets, books, music, and sundry
et c&aelig;teras indispensable upon such an occasion, we
found ourselves snugly ensconced upon the deck of
one of those spacious steamboats which hourly wend
their way toward the sunny shores for which we
were bound; and after an exhilarating sail of half an
hour's duration, we landed at Snug Harbor, and proceeded
toward our place of destination, which was
situated about ten minutes' walk distant.</p>

<p>It was to the Sailor's woods that our steps were
bent on the morning of our picknick. Sauntering
slowly through a shady lane we first passed the great
gate leading to the Sailor's Snug Harbor, an institution
which, as you doubtless know, Cousin Mary,
was, through the munificence of a certain private individual,
erected some years since as a place of refuge
and repose to the weary, wayworn seaman. Walking
a short distance beyond these stately buildings, we
found ourselves within "the deep solitudes of the
leafy wood."</p>

<p>How shall I describe to you, gentle coz, that dear
old woods, as on that eventful day its beauties and
wonders first greeted my gaze? We had not advanced
far within its recesses, when a welcome
sound fell upon our ears, and in a moment more</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"The flashing ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joyous waters in their play,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>came gladly upon our sight. A laughing little
streamlet rose before us, its bright waters rippling
and dancing, and here and there illuminated by a
stray sunbeam that stole softly and faintly through
the thick foliage of the sturdy old trees above. The
brook was narrow, and one could have crossed it
almost at a bound; but there was no necessity for
the exertion, for glancing but a few yards ahead, we
beheld a rustic bridge, which, on nearer approach,
proved to be of cedar, and was ornamented with a
sofa of the same material.</p>

<p>Upon this rude couch we rested awhile till our
friend C&mdash;&mdash;, whom we had elected master of ceremonies,
went forward to take a more extended survey
of the woods and its surroundings. In a few minutes
we heard a loud and very expressive halloo from our
absent companion, and looking about to find whence
the sound proceeded, we beheld him standing upon a
stone-fence at some distance, and beckoning us to
hasten immediately to his side. The mandate was
obeyed, and after a scramble over the stones, we
succeeded in mounting the desired eminence, when
a pleasant sight met our delighted visions. The
waters of the brook were here so managed as to form
two sylvan lakes, divided from each other by a bridge
similar to the one previously mentioned. The borders
of these lakes, through one of which glided two stately
swans, were supplied with seats formed of cedar
wood, and so arranged as to resemble lounges, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>,
and arm-chairs, whose appearance seemed
to invite repose. And here we would fain have
lingered, but asserting that he had something to show
us in another direction, C&mdash;&mdash; bade us follow him a
few steps farther.</p>

<p>Descending from our elevation, and roaming through
a shadowed path, we at last halted at the door of a
diminutive and picturesque-looking cottage, within
which, to our astonishment, was a table, round
which were ranged seats more than sufficient for our
number. In no measured terms did we now express
our surprise and delight at thus finding in the very
heart of the wilderness accommodations so necessary,
wondering at the same time whether the fairies had
not been there before us to provide every thing for
our convenience.</p>

<p>Beside the door of this rustic dwelling an old man,
evidently nearing the allotted "three score and
ten," was seated upon a rude bench, busily engaged
weaving a small and dainty-looking basket. He
was dressed in a sailor's garb, but there was an indescribable
something in his appearance, betraying
that he did not belong to the lowest rank of seamen.
There was a cloud of melancholy upon his countenance,
and though the sounds of laughter and mirth
were floating around him, he desisted not from his
occupation, nor even once gazed into the bright faces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
by which he was surrounded. Absorbed in his own
meditations, he seemed not to heed nor care for
aught else; and it was some time ere any of us presumed
to address him. But after awhile C&mdash;&mdash;, who
was on every occasion the most venturesome of our
group, approached the old man, and endeavored to
lead him into conversation. He did not resist the
attempt, and we now learned that the various adornments
of the woods were entirely the handiwork of
an aged sailor, to whose taste and ingenuity many
a previous picknick party had owed the greater
portion of its pleasures. He showed us a spring
near by, where we regaled ourselves with a libation
of the purest and coldest water, and told us of a
fitting place for a dance, an even, grass-grown spot
in another part of the woods. He also described to
us a moss-house, which he said was located just below
the opposite hill, informing us at the same time
that it belonged to the estate of Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, one of
New York's merchant-princes, who kindly and unselfishly
left it free and open to the inspection of the
curious, and wonder-loving community. And to
this latter domain my friends now agreed to adjourn&mdash;but
much to my regret, I was unable to accompany
them. A severe headache, the usual result of
excitement of any kind, was now exerting its influence
over me; and I was confident, from experience,
that my only way of soon getting rid of it
would be by remaining where I was and keeping
perfectly quiet. All of my friends expressed their
sorrow at my sudden indisposition, and each one
kindly offered to stay and bear me company; but unwilling
to deprive them of any enjoyment, I declined
their offers, alleging that I should not be altogether
alone, as the old man whom we found there would
doubtless continue where he was till their return.
The sailor looked up as I spoke, and said that it was
his intention to remain there for the rest of the morning,
adding that he frequently passed the entire day
in the woods. So, assured that I would not be
actually solitary, they at last allowed themselves to
be persuaded to go without me in search of the
moss-house.</p>

<p>After watching their forms till they had quite receded
from my view, I re-entered the arbor where
the old sailor was still at work, and seated myself
very comfortably in a rocking-chair. It was somewhat
of an oddity, too, Mary&mdash;that rocking-chair;
and though I had almost forgotten to mention the
circumstance to you, the first discovery of such an
article of furniture in the woods had been a source
of infinite amusement to my companions and myself.
It was built of cedar, to correspond with the other
various decorations of the woods, and though hewn
of the roughest material, for ease and grace of motion,
I might confidently challenge the drawing-room
of a fashionable lady to produce its equal. Again, I
say, it was an oddity&mdash;that rocking-chair. But the
powers of my simple pen being scarcely adequate to
a description of it, this being, as I have styled it, a
true reminiscence, I would advise and invite you,
dear Mary, if you wish to behold the rocker, and
judge of its <i>indescribable</i> merits, to accompany me
on the first summer's day you may have to spare, to
the pleasantest and most romantic spot in the immediate
vicinity of New York&mdash;the Sailor's Woods at
Snug Harbor.</p>

<p>But to go on with my record. After enjoying for
a space the easy lulling motion of this inimitable
chair; and after bathing my head repeatedly in water
from the woodland-spring, I began to feel considerably
revived, while the pure air, and the stillness
that reigned around, were of especial benefit to my
aching temples. The pain gradually grew less and
less tormenting, till at length it was no longer felt,
and again I found myself watching the old sailor,
who sat at a few paces from me weaving his pretty,
delicate basket. Gathering courage, I entered into
conversation with him. He had stated previously
that his abode was at "the Harbor," so I now made
some inquiries concerning that institution, its regulations,
&amp;c., and he very readily gave me all the
requisite information.</p>

<p>"They must be very happy, are they not?" I asked,
referring to the members of the institution of which
we were speaking; "very happy and very thankful,
too, to have had so pleasant a home provided for
them in their old age?"</p>

<p>"They are generally contented," was the reply,
"but there are many among their number who,
having no fears for their earthly future, allow their
minds to dwell too earnestly upon the past&mdash;and wo
be to them, if one voice from the memories of bygone
days comes back with reproachful accents!"
He sighed heavily&mdash;and for some moments there was
a pause. At length, raising his eyes hastily to mine,
he said,</p>

<p>"Young lady&mdash;do you think that <i>I</i> am happy?"</p>

<p>The question was altogether so abrupt and unexpected,
that I scarcely knew what to answer; but,
after some little hesitation, I replied, "I do not, sir.
There is too much of sadness in your countenance
to speak of a mind quite at ease. I should think that
you had known many sorrows."</p>

<p>"You are right," he rejoined, in a voice of emotion,
"I have, indeed, borne the burden of many
griefs; but, alas! I do not mourn them so much as
the errors of a heart but for whose weakness they
had never oppressed me. I know not what it is,
young lady, that prompts me to confide to you my
history. But, perchance, it may serve you as a
warning&mdash;it may impress more strongly upon your
mind that divine law of forgiveness inculcated by
Him who pardons <i>our</i> trespasses, 'as we forgive
those who trespass against us.' There is a passage
in the 'Book of Books' that never fails to convey to
me a reproof, for I remembered not the lesson till it
was too late to profit by it. 'Then came one of his
disciples unto him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven
times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee
until seven times; but until seventy times seven.'"</p>

<p>Though somewhat surprised at the turn matters
were taking, yet, as the speaker had paused, and
was now apparently awaiting some token on my
part of interest in his proposed narration, <i>I</i>, of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
entreated him to proceed. Nor was he long in
complying with my desire.</p>

<p>It was truly a touching story, dear Mary. I would,
indeed, that I could "tell the tale as 'twas told to
me." And yet I would not, if I possessed the power,
portray the mournful accents of that old man's voice,
and the sorrowing expression of his countenance&mdash;for
the picture would make you weep. I may not
attempt to recall the sketch in the language of the
aged sailor, for that it would be utterly impossible
to do; but I will strive to repeat it to you after my
own peculiar fashion, and to the best of my ability.
Could I boast your incomparable grace of diction,
Mary, I might do full justice to my subject. But I
know that with your accustomed kindness you will
overlook the faults which I humbly trust that time
and practice may enable me to overcome. So,
having thus worthily delivered my preface, let me
hasten at once to my task.</p>

<p>Some sixty years since, there dwelt in the city of
Boston, a merchant by the name of Sydney&mdash;a man
justly beloved and respected for benevolence of
character, integrity of purpose and of principle, and
envied by the worldly for the enormous income
which enabled him to surround his family with every
luxury that money could procure. Early in life he
had married a beautiful girl, to whom he was tenderly
devoted. A son, whose name was Arthur,
and who, to come at once to the point, was the
original narrator of this story, was the sole offspring
of this happy union, and, as may be supposed, the
pride and idol of his parents. They watched over
him with the most untiring affection, and endeavored
to instil into his young mind those firm and honorable
principles which rendered their own lives so
lovely. But at the age of ten years the hand of
death deprived Arthur Sydney of his gentle mother,
and daily he missed her counsels and her embrace,
and most bitterly did he mourn for the footstep that
was to come no more.</p>

<p>The loss of his wife was a stunning blow to Mr.
Sydney. He never married again, for he had loved
the departed one too well to think for an instant of
supplying her place; and so four more years elapsed,
and his child continued to be the only object of his
cares. But at the termination of that period this
good and just man was called to a mansion beyond
the skies, doubtless there to claim the crown of immortality.
And then Arthur was left alone in the wide
world&mdash;a young and almost broken-hearted orphan.</p>

<p>Upon searching into Mr. Sydney's affairs soon
after his decease, to the surprise of every one,
instead of leaving his son in the possession of an
immense estate, there was not quite sufficient to
meet the demands of creditors. When Arthur Sydney
became older, he could not help suspecting that there
was some mystery about this, for strictly honest as
he had ever known his father to be, he could not believe
that he would ever have swerved thus from the
path of right. What was in reality the cause of this
deficiency, whether it was owing, as his son afterward
thought, to the craft and fraud of his executors,
can only be answered from the curtain of futurity.</p>

<p>The mansion where Arthur's early years had
passed so happily, was now sold, with all its effects,
and the lonely orphan took up his abode beneath
the roof of an uncle. But, alas! it was not like the
home he had lost&mdash;the dear hearth of his sunny
childhood. His relative, Mr. Lindsay, was a far
different being from his deceased parent, and though,
like the latter, he lived in splendor, he knew not
how to enjoy it. Devoid of that generosity of spirit
which Mr. Sydney had possessed, he was also of a
morose, exacting, and passionate nature, and his
family, instead of hailing his presence with delight,
shrunk from him ever with indifference, and sometimes
with trembling. Governed by the law of fear
instead of that of love, it was scarcely to be wondered
at that his children resorted to every petty
means of covering their faults, and were often guilty
of deception and falsehood. Arthur Sydney's education
had been widely different, and he despised
the meannesses which his cousins practiced; but
when he expostulated with them, as he frequently
did, his words invariably drew upon himself a torrent
of invectives. They taunted him with his dependence
upon their father's charity, and asked what
right a beggar had to preach to <i>them</i>; and then the
youth's proud heart would swell within him, and he
would rush to his own little room, and there, unseen,
give full vent to his wounded feelings.</p>

<p>His eldest cousin, Alfred Lindsay, who was always
foremost in every plan of mischief, and the most
perfect adept in concealing the part he had taken in
it, was a twelvemonth Arthur's senior. From earliest
childhood the two had evinced a dislike to each
other's society, and as they grew up, the feeling did
not diminish. At school they had been rivals, and
Arthur had now far outstripped Alfred in their course
of study. In various other ways he had also quite
unintentionally foiled his cousin's ambition; and he
was convinced that at the first opportunity Alfred
would have his revenge. Too soon was the fore-boding
realized.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay one afternoon entered the room where
his children generally spent their leisure hours, and
with threatening looks announced that he had lost a
ten dollar bank note. He had missed it under such
circumstances that he was sure it must have been
purloined by one of the younger members of his
family; and he now declared his intention of searching
both their persons and their apartments, that he
might, if possible, discover the guilty one. Very
pale were the young faces that now gathered round
him; and though Arthur's heart was free from reproach,
he, too, trembled with fear for the criminal.
I need not dwell upon the details of that search, but
suffice it to say that the bank-note was found&mdash;found
in <i>Arthur Sydney's</i> apartment, within a little box
that always stood upon his dressing-table as the
honored receptacle of his parents' miniatures. Vainly
did he assert his ignorance as to how it came there&mdash;his
uncle refused to listen to his words, and loaded
with passionate reproaches, he was dismissed to his
own room, there to remain till he received permission
to leave it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a long while ere the boy became sufficiently
calm to reflect upon what had occurred, for the
thought that he was accused of theft came with such
bitterness to his soul that for several hours he was
almost frantic. But as he grew more composed he
became confident that this was the work of Alfred,
and he remembered the triumphant leer that stood
upon his cousin's countenance when the hiding-place
of the missing note was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Just at this moment his meditations were disturbed
by the sound of footsteps stealthily approaching his
door, and the next instant it was opened, and Alfred
Lindsay stood upon the threshold, gazing exultingly
upon Arthur's misery, while a malicious smile
wreathed his lips as pointing his finger exultingly at
him, the single word, "thief!" fell upon the ear of
his victim. Oh! how that undeserved epithet stung
the innocent and sensitive boy; and, almost maddened
by the sense of his injuries, he rushed toward
the offender, impelled by but one thought&mdash;the wish
for revenge. But, coward-like, Alfred fled from his
approach, and then closing the door, and locking it,
Arthur threw himself upon his couch in tearless,
voiceless agony. It was not until the shades of
evening had closed in that he roused himself from
the stupor into which he had been thrown by those
overpowering emotions. And now came a determination
that he would no longer remain in his
uncle's house, where he knew that he must ever after
be subjected to the sneers and gibes of his cousins.
He resolved to quit Mr. Lindsay's dwelling, though
he knew not of any other roof where he might find a
shelter for his aching head.</p>

<p>That night, when the unbroken stillness that reigned
around gave assurance that the family had all retired
to rest, Arthur Sydney stole softly down the stairs,
and taking with him nothing but a small bundle of
clothing, and the few treasured memorials of other
days that he could lawfully call his own, he left
forever the mansion of his uncle. And as he looked
his last upon the home of Alfred Lindsay, there rose
in his heart a wild, dark resolve, that if he ever possessed
the power, his cousin should one day reap
the fruits of his evil deed.</p>

<p>For hours the youth wandered listlessly through
the now deserted streets of the city, till at last overcome
with fatigue, and completely unnerved as the
full sense of his desolate situation burst upon him,
he seated himself near the edge of one of the wharves,
and wept long and bitterly. Suddenly a hand was
laid upon his shoulder, and a voice whose tones
though rough were yet full of sympathy, inquired the
cause of his grief, and looking hastily up, he beheld
a man apparently about fifty years of age, and habited
in a seaman's garb. Touched with his kindness, in
the first impulse of the moment, Arthur gave him a
brief account of his misfortunes. When he had concluded,
much to his surprise, his listener informed
him that he had known his father, who had, years
before, rendered him an important service, in return
for which, he said that he would now willingly do
all in his power to serve the child of one to whom he
was so deeply indebted. He told Arthur that he was
at present commander of a large vessel lying close at
hand, and which was to sail the following day for
South America, and asked if he would be willing to
accompany him, and learn to be a sailor like himself.
The idea was a novel one, and the boy seized upon
it with avidity, as beside being his only available
means of obtaining life's necessaries, he knew that
by embracing it he should lose the chance of meeting
those relatives whom he cared no more to behold.
And when he at once expressed his readiness to go,
his new friend patted his head in token of approval,
prophesied that he would prove a brave mariner,
and then taking his young companion by the hand,
led him toward the ship which was henceforth to be
his abiding-place. The next day Arthur bade adieu
to his native city, and commenced his career as a
seamen. But upon the events of that career I have
not time to linger. For years Captain Carter, for
such was his patron's name, continued to treat his
<i>proteg&eacute;</i> with unremitting favor, sharing with him all
the nautical knowledge he had acquired, and using
every endeavor for his advancement. At the age of
eight-and-twenty, through this kind friend's interest,
Arthur was himself raised to the post of captain, and
took possession of a packet-ship sailing between the
ports of New York and Southampton. He had now
attained the summit of his hopes, for a way was
opened before him of obtaining, what had long been
his desire, a competence, which would enable him to
resume that station in life which his father had occupied,
and of supplying also to his parent's creditors
the sum of which they had been so strangely defrauded.
And at the close of five more years he had
the satisfaction of knowing that this latter purpose
was accomplished.</p>

<p>It was about this period that an incident occurred
which had a material influence over the future destiny
of Arthur Sydney. During one of his voyages,
accident revealed to his notice the wreck of what had
once apparently been a noble vessel. He immediately
despatched a boat with a portion of his crew
to survey the ruins, and ascertain if any of the passengers
survived. They returned, bringing with
them the inanimate form of a lovely girl, seemingly
not more than eighteen years old. Every effort was
used for her speedy restoration to consciousness,
but it was nearly two hours ere she opened her eyes,
and then she was so weak as to be quite unable to
move or speak. Her delicate frame was evidently
exhausted by long fasting, and the fearful scenes she
must have witnessed; and for the whole of that day
Sydney watched beside her with feelings of the
strongest sympathy for her sufferings. The next
morning she was much better, she could recline in
an easy chair, and had acquired sufficient strength to
relate her history. She was a native of Italy&mdash;the
youngest daughter of an ancient and noble family,
whose father having been undeservedly regarded by
the government with suspicion, was threatened with
imprisonment, and had barely time to escape with
his household on board of a ship bound for America.
That vessel was the one whose wreck Captain
Sydney had espied, and of the large number of souls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
within it, who had departed but a few weeks before
from Italia's sunny shores, but one remained&mdash;that
gentle and helpless maiden. For three days she
had continued upon the wreck without the slightest
sustenance, haunted by the memories of the terrible
past, and expecting that each instant would dash the
frail fabric to pieces, and precipitate her also into
the deep, dark sea, till at length consciousness forsook
her, and in a death-like swoon she forgot the
dangers by which she was surrounded.</p>

<p>With tears of anguish she now spoke of the dear
ones lost to her forever on earth&mdash;the loved mother,
the noble father, the darling sisters, and the cherished
brother, over each one of whom she had beheld the
wild waves close. Then she lamented her desolation,
utterly destitute, and nearing the shores of a
foreign land, where no familiar voice would accord
her a welcome. There was a similarity in her situation
to what had once been his own, and as Sydney
listened, the story inspired him with an interest in
that fair being such as he had never till then experienced
for a fellow-creature. He used every
effort to console her&mdash;gave her an account of his
own early life, and bade her trust in the kind Providence
who in the hour of need had given <i>him</i> a
friend. He assured her also that he, at least, would
not forsake her, but that he would endeavor to place
her in some way of gaining her own livelihood till
she could write to and hear from her friends in Italy;
and begged that she would look upon him as a
brother. She heard him with glistening eyes, and
clasping his hand in hers, with child-like earnestness
expressed her thanks for his kindness.</p>

<p>During the rest of that voyage Captain Sydney
spent every leisure moment by the side of his beautiful
charge. Returning health imparted a bloom to
her cheek, and a lustre to her soft, dark eyes, and as
Arthur gazed upon her, he often thought that earth
had never owned a fairer flower. It was not long
ere he became fully conscious that she daily grew
dearer to him, and great was his joy as he marked
the flush that invariably rose to her pure forehead
when he approached. And when at length he poured
his tale of love into the ear of the sweet Leonor, the
reply that he sought was given with an impassioned
fervor that sent a thrill of rapture to his soul.</p>

<p>They were united the day that they landed at New
York, and renting a small but pretty cottage in the
outskirts of the city, Captain Sydney installed his
Leonor as the mistress of that pleasant domain. Here,
amidst flowers and birds, and enlivened by the music
of two loving hearts, the time glided tranquilly away
till the hour of separation arrived&mdash;and, for the first
time, Sydney quitted the land with regret, and embarked
once more upon the deep blue ocean.</p>

<p>Eight years after his marriage, Captain Sydney
was destined to weep over the cold corpse of his
lovely wife. She had never enjoyed uninterrupted
health since her residence beneath the variable clime
of her adoption, and at last she fell a victim to consumption.
Vainly did the anxious husband consult
the most celebrated physicians&mdash;the disease was incurable,
and ere the blossoms of spring again burst
forth, Leonor slumbered beneath the sod. Wild,
indeed, was the grief of the bereaved one at her loss&mdash;but
he recovered the first effects of his sorrow, and
leaving his only child, Harry, a brave boy just six
years of age, under the guardianship of a friend who
had loved the departed mother, Sydney resumed his
former vocation.</p>

<p>Years again fled. Harry Sydney attained the age
of manhood&mdash;and every one that knew him loved
him, for he was a fine, manly fellow, honorable and
generous in every impulse, with a heart susceptible
of the warmest sympathies. He inherited his mother's
ardent temperament, and was of a sensitive and impassioned
nature. Captain Sydney had destined him
for a merchant, and as such he had just commenced
life with every prospect of success. Had he been
allowed to take his own inclination as a guide, Harry
would fain have followed the sea. But to this his
father was averse, and early, at his command, he
relinquished the desire.</p>

<p>Upon his son all the hopes of Captain Sydney
were centered. It was his earnest wish to see him
happily married, and determined to express the desire
to Harry, he one day sought his side for that purpose.
Both to his surprise and approval, the latter informed
his father that he had already met one to whom his
heart's warmest affections were given. He added
that the young lady, though poor and dependent upon
her own exertions for her support, and that of an
invalid father, was the descendant of a family said to
be highly respectable. "Her grandfather," he continued,
"was Robert Lindsay, a well-known merchant
of Boston; and though his son, Alfred, has dissipated
the patrimony left him by his parent, and
now relies solely for maintenance upon the proceeds
of his daughter's needle, I am sure, my dear father,
this praiseworthy effort, on the part of one so young
and lovely as Ida, will but elevate her in your
estimation?"</p>

<p>"Robert Lindsay! Alfred Lindsay!" were the exclamations
of Captain Sydney, in a voice full of
passion, as those well-remembered names fell upon
his ear for the first time in many years; "boy&mdash;did
you say that <i>Alfred Lindsay</i> was her parent? Then
be assured that never, while life lasts, will I give
my consent to your marriage with the daughter of
him who was the enemy of my unprotected youth!"</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;what mean you?" asked Harry, in tones
of amazement, for the tale whose memory had so
sudden an effect upon his companion, had never
been breathed to him. And suddenly recalled to a
sense of his son's ignorance upon the subject, Captain
Sydney now hurriedly sketched the history of the past.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said Harry, musingly; "but
they never mentioned that they were related to me.
It is probable that Ida's father, if aware of the fact,
concealed it from her knowledge."</p>

<p>"Or rather that he instigated her to keep it a
secret, that in the end she might reap the benefit of
his injured cousin's wealth," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, father!" replied the young man, warmly.
"I could not wrong Ida by a suspicion of that kind.
She is too good and pure-hearted to countenance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
deception, and," he added, after a moment's hesitation,
"I cannot give her up and wreck both her own
happiness and mine, for the sake of her parent's
faults."</p>

<p>These words aroused Captain Sydney's indignation.
He accused his son of want of spirit in refusing
to resent the occurrences that clouded his
youth; and when Harry responded that he felt them
deeply, but could not on their account brand himself
with dishonor, by breaking the troth already plighted
to Ida Lindsay, his father parted from him in anger,
declaring that if his son married Ida, he might never
expect his blessing.</p>

<p>The thought of uniting his son by indissoluble ties
to the child of his early foe, was, indeed, repugnant
to the heart of Captain Sydney; and while he remembered
his resolve uttered on the night when he
went forth from his uncle's roof a desolate, friendless
and dishonored being&mdash;dishonored through the machinations
of his cousin Alfred&mdash;he was determined
that it should be fulfilled, even though in so doing
he thwarted the earnest wishes of the one dearest
to him.</p>

<p>A few days afterward Captain Sydney departed
upon one of his accustomed voyages, and was absent
several months. On his return he found his son just
recovering from a lingering fever, brought on, as the
physician averred, by distress of mind. He looked
very pale and thin, and his father could scarcely help
feeling a sensation akin to reproach, as he gazed
upon that colorless cheek and wasted form. He
knew that this indisposition was occasioned by the
manner in which he had treated his son's engagement,
for, through the medium of a friend, he had
learned that Ida Lindsay had nobly refused longer to
encourage attentions, which, as she learned from
Harry, were tendered in opposition to his father's
desires. Alfred Lindsay, too, had died a few weeks
before, and the object of his resentment being no
more, Captain Sydney began to feel less reluctant to
the match which he had at first looked upon with
such violent disapprobation. Conscience told him
he had acted cruelly in thus casting a blight over his
child's sweetest hopes, and he was determined that
he would now do all in his power to further them.
And when Harry grew strong enough to bear a conversation
upon the subject, he communicated the
change in his feelings. Both startled and appalled
was he at his son's reply.</p>

<p>"My father, would you mock me with this show
of kindness, when it is too late to profit by it? Know
you not that she is now dying of consumption? I was
sure that <i>she</i> was too delicate to endure the steady
occupation necessary for her support&mdash;and my presentiment
has been verified. Yes, Ida Lindsay is
dying! I would have saved her&mdash;I would have
borne her to a more genial clime, where she might,
perhaps, have revived; but she refused to give me a
right to be her guardian, for it was against the will
of my parent, without whose sanction, she said, our
union would never prosper."</p>

<p>He bowed his face, while for an instant his frame
shook with emotion. Hastily his father drew nearer
to him, but he turned shudderingly from those words
of penitence and self-reproach, and dashing aside
the extended hand, rushed from the apartment.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, too true&mdash;Ida Lindsay was dying!
The constant confinement called for by her continued
exertions to obtain a livelihood, had proved too much
for a constitution by no means strong&mdash;and it was his
anxiety for her failing health which had caused the
illness of Harry Sydney. Oh! what would not the
erring father have given for power to recall the past;
but it was too late&mdash;too late! A few hours after the
interview with his son the intelligence of Ida's death
was received, and during the whole of the succeeding
evening Captain Sydney could plainly distinguish
the sound of Harry's footsteps as he wildly paced his
chamber, and each echo sent a thrill of remorse to
his soul. Little did the repentant and sorrowing
parent then think it was the last time that footfall
would ever resound in his dwelling&mdash;for that night
Harry Sydney departed from his home, leaving no
trace of his destination. Days, weeks, months
passed on, and the heart of his father grew dark
with the anguish of despair, for he felt most surely
that he should behold his son no more. Whither the
latter had gone was a mystery he tried in vain to solve,
though sometimes he remembered Harry's predilection
for a mariner's life, and blighted as he had been
in his affections, might he not now have followed the
yearnings of former times, as the only means of
gaining oblivion of his sorrows? So, night after
night, Captain Sydney sat alone at his deserted hearth&mdash;a
father, and yet childless, with a host of dark recollections
pressing heavily upon his spirit. And at
last he sought forgetfulness of his errors in the sparkling
wine-cup, whose draught he drained with an
intense eagerness, for it enabled him to mock at his
misery.</p>

<p>And so five more years passed on, during which
period his mind was seldom free from the delirium
produced by the practices to which he had resorted;
and having, in utter recklessness of spirit dissipated
his property, deprived, through his own weakness, of
his rank as captain, he was at length forced to lower
himself to the grade of a common sailor, for the purpose
of obtaining the means of subsistence. Then a
severe illness, caused by free indulgence in intoxicating
liquors, overtook him&mdash;and with sickness came
reflection, and he resolved to yield no longer to the
voice of the tempter. He recovered from his dangerous
indisposition, but remaining fearfully weak,
the physician declared that his constitution was completely
shattered, and that he was no longer fit for
service. At first he insisted upon resuming his
wonted occupation, for he had no other way of
maintaining himself. The physician seemed to comprehend
his reluctance to obey his command, and he
now reminded his patient of an institution in the
vicinity of New York, where the indigent mariner
might find a home.</p>

<p>It was then that Captain Sydney&mdash;for so let me
still continue to call him&mdash;sought the peaceful shades
of "the Harbor," where for two years he had, indeed,
found all the external comforts of a home, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
but for the voices of the past he would have had no
cause to repine.</p>

<p>About a twelvemonth after his arrival at "the
Harbor," a new inmate was admitted there, in the
person of an invalid sailor, who was said to be in a
deep decline. He seldom left the apartment allotted
to him, save now and then of a warm sunny day,
when he would go forth, leaning upon the arm of an
attendant, and seating himself upon a bench in the
garden beneath the shade of a tree, remain there for
hours, gazing silently upon the blue waters of the
bay before him. Regarded by all as in a dying state,
no one strove at these times to disturb his reverie.
His situation had excited universal sympathy, and
frequently the other sailors would steal to his side
and softly deposit there a small basket of fruit, or
some little delicacy which they knew would prove
acceptable to him on whom it was bestowed.</p>

<p>Habitually reserved, and cultivating but little intercourse
with those around him, it was scarcely a
matter of surprise that for some weeks Captain
Sydney took but little notice of the sailor of whom
I have been speaking. But chance at length brought
him more fully beneath the scope of his observation.
While one day walking in the garden, buried in
thought, almost unconsciously he neared the spot
generally occupied by the invalid. But he heeded
not the vicinity till startled by the sound of a hollow
cough, and looking hastily up, he met the gaze of
the feeble stranger. A half-suppressed cry burst
from the latter, and springing quickly forward, Captain
Sydney caught him in his arms, while the words,
"Harry! my son&mdash;my son!" came in a tone of agony
from his lips. But he heeded not the caresses&mdash;he
answered not the words of mingled endearment and
reproach which his parent murmured as he bent
wildly over him; and when at length the stricken
father became calm enough to summon assistance,
they told him that the spirit of his child was at rest.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Such, my dear cousin, was the old man's history;
and as he ceased, his head leaned droopingly upon
his hand, while his whole attitude betokened the
most intense mental suffering. For some moments
there was silence between us, for I felt that words
were insufficient to console him. But suddenly the
stillness was broken by the sound of lively voices
approaching, and I recognized the tones of my long-absent
companions, and knew that they were close
at hand. In a few seconds more, they appeared near
the stone-fence, which I have once before alluded to.
The old sailor evidently wished to avoid them, for
their gayety was discordant to his feelings. Rising
from his seat, he now drew closer to the spot where
I was stationed.</p>

<p>"Farewell, young lady," were his parting words,
as he clasped my extended hand, and for a moment
that pale, sad face, looked so mournfully into mine,
that tears of the deepest commiseration sprung
involuntarily to my eyes, "we may never meet again,
and I trust you will forgive me, if the repetition of
my sorrows has cast a shadow upon your heart. Remember
me in your prayers, if you will, and ask that
I may soon be borne to my last repose in the little grave-yard
yonder, where my son lies sleeping. Farewell."</p>

<p>An instant more and he was gone&mdash;and for some
moments I remained seated where he had left me,
patiently awaiting the approach of my friends, and
meanwhile musing earnestly and sadly upon the
Sailor's Life-Tale.</p>

<h3>ON SOME OF THE EVENTS OF THE YEAR 1848.</h3>

<hr class="short" />
<h4>BY JOSEPH R. CHANDLER.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<h5><i>Annus Mirabilis.</i></h5>


<p>We are approaching the close of the year&mdash;a year
marked by greater vicissitudes in the affairs of nations
than any in which we have lived&mdash;any indeed
of which we have read. History gives us accounts
of the rapid march and equally rapid conquests by
ambitious kings, who seemed only happy in the unhappiness
of others, and only proud of destroying
that which constituted the pride of others. From
time to time ambitious men have exhibited themselves
in the great theatre of the world, and their
greatness has been measured by the extent of misery
they have produced; and their claims to permanent
fame have rested upon the rapidity that marked their
destruction of cities, kingdoms and empires. While
between the epochs which are distinguished by these
promoters of extensive mischief, there have at all
times been humble imitators of their crimes, whose
limited power of doing confined their actions to provinces,
and compelled them to be ministers of local
vengeance, and the enjoyers of that petty infamy
which results from numerable murders and calculable
crime. It is but too evident that order has had its
antagonists, at all times and in all degrees, and if
history has been employed with the works of those
whose extensive scale of action gives larger consequence
to their movements, it cannot be doubted
that society has been convulsed at its centre by the
restless and the bad, who have been as efficient in
their sphere of wrong doing as have been those who
occupied a larger space. The latter struck the elevated,
and disturbed public relations; the former sent
home its weapon to the humble, and brought disturbance
and misery into the more limited circle, reaching
social life and stabbing even to the heart of domestic
peace.</p>

<p>Such great events have marked epochs, or made
them; and such small occurrences have been the
characteristics of almost all times; so that the wars
of the present century may be considered but as continuations
of the belligerent movements of other
times, modified indeed by the improvement of the
present age, but still of the same spirit and from the
same motives. But the events of the past year are
of another kind. The disturbances that have distinguished
the history of Europe in that time are not
the result of the mad ambition of a conqueror to add
to his possessions, and subjugate kings and kingdoms
as a means of gratifying ambition; foreign conquest
and invasion from abroad are not now the occurrences
which European rulers fear or anticipate.
The convulsions that distinguish every empire from
the Atlantic to the Black Sea, has nothing to do with
the ambition of other <i>rulers</i> but are referable to the
rising spirit of their own <i>people</i>. No longer do the
States of Germany combine to repel the assaults of
the ruler of France. Each member of the nominal
confederacy is looking to itself as possessing the
active means of revolution, and each leans toward
a combination that shall sustain the rights of the
people and put a specific limit to the power of
princes.</p>

<p>No longer do men startle at the grasping avarice
of the upper powers demanding new possessions and
the recognition of enlarged prerogative; no longer
is the peace of nations disturbed by the attempts of
an ambitious ruler to extend his domains and enlarge
his power. The convulsions that are everywhere
in Europe felt, come from the up-heaving of the lower
masses; deep down in the bosom of empires is heard
the voice of multitudes crying out for newly understood
rights. Up from that stratum comes a convulsive
heave, that is toppling down the thrones that
have rested upon the hearts of the people, and not
outside the national limits, not at the terminal portions,
not at the "outer walls" of the capital is the
movement felt&mdash;but within, at the heart of the nation,
within the shadow of the palace, along the quays
where business is pursued, in the narrow walks of
trade, over the bench of the artisan, or in the boudoir
of beauty, is planned the movement that is subverting
thrones and leveling up society. For nearly a
century past have there been at work the elements
of such convulsion. The struggle of the antagonistic
powers has been such that results were postponed&mdash;only
postponed&mdash;while the injurers lost
power, and the injured gathered strength. Premonitory
movements were observed, and in some instances
seconded, as in France, in others allayed by
power or concessions, as in Austria and Great Britain.
But when the whole is only a right, the acquisition
of a part is only a prelude to a struggle for
more, and this has been seen in every nation where
concession was made to the people, or wrung by
force from the rulers.</p>

<p>But there was reserved for the present year the
great assertion of human rights. The annunciation
was first made in France, where tyranny galled the
sensitive portions of the people, or where a taste of
temporary freedom had created an appetite for constant
enjoyment. The flight of Louis Philippe seemed
sudden&mdash;startling&mdash;almost without a cause; and if
nothing but the <i>&eacute;meute</i> in Paris is regarded, certainly
the effect was entirely disproportioned to the cause.
But the revolution of the 22d of February was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
natural consequence of the pre-existing state of things.
The fall of the leaf in autumn is not a more natural
result of a waning season than was the fall of Louis
Philippe a consequence of exhausted monarchy.
The spirit of the people had come up to that point at
which monarchy must either assume the form of
absolutism, and rule by fear alone, or must yield to
the upward pressure of the people, and its possessors
seek to escape the opposing principle which they
could not withstand. Louis Philippe tried the former&mdash;it
was too late&mdash;the army, that last hope of tyrants,
the sword and the bayonet <i>hired</i> to defend the throne
became the people's support&mdash;failing in the effort to
fix his power by blood, Louis Philippe fled to save
his life; a common movement of French monarchs.</p>

<p>France may or may not establish republican institutions.
Love of monarchy will not prevent the
fulfillment of her people's hopes&mdash;difference of opinion
as it regards degrees of freedom, and want of
self sacrifice, we mean the sacrifice of personal
views, (there will never be a want of self sacrifice of
human life in France,) will do more to retard the
establishment of republicanism in France than all the
lingering attachments to monarchy that can be hunted
up in the Faubourg de St. Germain, or in all the
isolated ch&acirc;teux of the interior of the country. The
habits, not the affections of the mass of the French
people may also be regarded as one obstacle to true
republicanism&mdash;a constantly diminishing obstacle, it
is true, but still a formidable obstacle.</p>

<p>The revolution in France was the signal (not the
<i>preconcerted</i> signal, as it should have been,) for a
general insurrectionary movement, and no sooner
had the press announced the departure of Louis Philippe,
than forthwith Poland gave signs of life&mdash;Austria
heaved with the workings of the under stratum&mdash;Hungary
demanded independence&mdash;Prussia
was in an insurrectionary state&mdash;a voice was heard
from Russia&mdash;and Italy from the Alps to the Straights
of Otranto began to try the strength of those fetters
which indolence, ignorance and ease had allowed to
be fastened upon her. The history of the revolutionary
movements on this peninsula has yet to be
written; it is full of interest, and if presented impartially,
with a correct reference to causes, both of
tyranny and insurrection, must prove deeply moving
and instructive. We cannot do more than refer to
the fact that Italy has been aroused; that tyranny
has received a blow from which it can never wholly
recover, and that there, as well as elsewhere, the
rights of man have been proclaimed&mdash;proclaimed in
part&mdash;proclaimed with doubts, with erroneous conceptions,
with false views and an unchastened spirit,
but still proclaimed, and what is more, openly admitted&mdash;admitted
with purer views of property, more
definite ideas of practicability, chastened wishes and
paternal feelings. All is right in its tendencies.
The false perceptions are owing to the suddenness
of the light recently admitted. The inclusiveness of
demands spring from a want of knowledge of the
sacrifices which order requires from the friends of
liberty&mdash;success will correct these views, and experience
show the path which true patriotism opens.</p>

<p>Regarding, as we do, all movements as effects of
Providential direction, we cannot forbear to consider
the election of Pius IX. to the papal throne as
an important part of that providence, in regard to the
Peninsula of Italy in particular, and, perhaps, to the
whole world. The correctness of the doctrine which
makes that prelate a spiritual chief, or the propriety
of uniting temporal with spiritual power, are questions
to be settled elsewhere. Both exist, and both
have an influence on the movements of nations; and
the character of the new administrator of the Papal
See, had at once an effect on his own subjects and
upon all the people of Italy, and, through the people,
upon the rulers. The new Pope seemed to have
stepped forward a century from the line occupied by
his predecessor, and to have stood in the front ranks
of the reformers of the age. He was young, no old
habits of yielding retarded his movements. He was
young, none of the nervous tremulousness of age,
that is shocked at the proposition of <i>change</i>, made
him deaf to the demands of the time. He was young,
and he had not yet been hardened into that unyieldingness
of age that distinguishes the veteran church-man,
who mingles the necessity of faith in <i>divine</i>
doctrines with the necessity of non-resistance to
human precepts. He knew and sympathized in the
feelings which had animated the Italians: he was
not ignorant that the prisons had been filled by men
charged with crimes which the oppression of Austria
provoked, and which the espionage of Austria detected
and caused to be punished. He felt that his
own temporal power was abused by the overawing
influence of Austria, and he pardoned those who had
offended only a foreign potentate, and were suffering
under the condemnation of their own rulers. He
would have led the movement to a peaceful and desirable
result, but, alas! the oppression of centuries
had made the many mad; and their limbs had been
so galled with the manacles of political oppression
that they became restive under the wholesome restraints
that order and appropriate government demand;
dragged forward by these eccentric bodies,
and restrained by the timidity and prejudices of some
of his legitimate advisers, Pius has felt that his triple
crown was the means of triple sorrow; but he has
also shown that he understood the maxim, that "he
only is fitted to rule who knows how to sacrifice."</p>

<p>The arms of the Italian States and the influence of
the Pope have been successful against Austria, and
even though that overgrown and tumid empire should
reconquer all her late possessions in Lombardy, and
be as omnipotent in Venice as she is in Triest or
Vienna, still the prestige of power is gone, and she
can no longer extend an influence over the human
mind that tends upward in its views. The <i>taste</i> of
independence has been enjoyed&mdash;the tree of knowledge
has yielded some of its fruits&mdash;and hereafter
there can be no rest, no quiet, without something of
liberty, much of science.</p>

<p>The question has been raised as to the existence of
the power of the Pope deprived of his temporalities.
That is, can the Pope yield up the government of the
Papal States to a secular ruler, and maintain the full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
amount of spiritual power which he now exercises,
and which he and those of his creed deem a necessary
portion of his official life.</p>

<p>We are noways concerned in the settlement of
that question, beyond its bearing upon the condition
of Italy, and through her upon many other portions
of the earth. We do not know that there is <i>now</i> any
probability that the Papal States will pass under another
ruler than the Pope; but we entertain no doubt
that the Pope could exercise all the functions of
Bishop of Rome, with all the supremacy which he
claims for that office over other bishoprics, as well
without the appanages of temporalities as with them.
There is nothing in the office, or all that is claimed
for it, that renders direct temporal power necessary.
Bishops of Rome existed for centuries with all the
spiritual supremacy now claimed, but as destitute of
temporal power as the bishops of any other city.
And the custom which rendered concurrent the temporal
rule&mdash;or admitted of extraordinary pomp&mdash;has
never been deemed more than a concurrence&mdash;never
a necessity. And it is a fact that when the invasion
of a foreign power has stripped the Pope of his territories,
and made even Rome the home of invaders,
attention has been at once turned to the separation of
spiritualities from temporalities, and means adopted
to drop the machinery of secular government, and
keep active and useful that of the church alone.</p>

<p>It is, we believe, an admitted fact, that among the
papers of the Cardinal Prime Minister of Pius VII.,
who was carried away and kept a prisoner in France
by Napoleon, were found plans for carrying on the
spiritual offices of the Pope without the least connection
with temporal power; and Rome was to be
to its bishop no more than Philadelphia to either of
the bishops who reside therein, and administer the
dioceses committed to their care.</p>

<p>We mention these things, and dwell upon them,
because speculation is, and has been, active with regard
to the effect of the revolution in Italy, some
movements of which evidently looked to the transfer
of all temporal power to laymen; and extraordinary
effects were supposed to be the necessary results of
such a change. The change seems to us very probable,
and not very remote; but it does not appear
to us that the spiritual functions (proper) of the Pope
will be essentially disturbed by any such movement.</p>

<p>We dwell longer on Italy than its geographical
dimensions would warrant, but that peninsula is
deeply interesting to the world, not only on account
of the religious relations to which we have referred,
but from the fact that for centuries a foreign arm has
held it down; and while half of the world beside was
rising into consequence, by the science and scientific
men that Italy sent forth, Italy alone of all the geographical
divisions of the earth seemed to be without
profit from her own great men. Because she <i>did</i>
decay, men believed that the elements of her prosperity
were exhausted; because she ceased to hold
the preeminence which she once possessed, it was
deemed that the seal of ruin was set upon her. These
suppositions are wrong; and the new movements in
that peninsula show that the spirit of man is yet
active, and <i>now</i> active to man's great good. What
Italy needed was concert. What other nations practiced
were constant attempts to foment jealousies
among her different States, and create a demand for
foreign interference and the presence of foreign
troops. At present a dream of the ancient republic
is the animating cause (or rather perhaps a sense of
the capabilities of Italy for the new republicanism of
the time) with leaders; who appeal to the recollections
of the past because a sense of the present is
not to be depended on in the many; and the shout for
the old federative republics of past centuries awakens
the pride of those whose patriotism might not be
strong enough to lead them to the sacrifices which
the object demands.</p>

<p>There seems to be necessary to the Italian mind a
hope of regaining something that has been <i>lost</i>, and
if this is rightly used there can be no doubt that the
people will attain to something they <i>need</i>. The republics
of elder Italy are no more the proper object
for Italian enterprise, than would be the old colonial
dependencies for the efforts of Americans. But
Italy must be aroused; she must be called up to some
general object; her great men must be stimulated to
useful efforts, and her humbler citizens must be enticed
away from insurrectionary movements to revolutionary
action, and that cry which the soonest
rouses and unites them is the true watchword of independence.
Some proper hand, some well endowed
mind must lead them in the right path&mdash;must set
their faces and direct their efforts toward the proper
object. The alarm cry may be the same, though the
object of rising be opposite to that announced. The
same bells and the same peels would call up the citizens
of Florence to withstand or divert an inundation
of the Arno which would be used to arouse
them to check the destructive progress of a conflagration.</p>

<p>Italy, however, must not be kept too long in chase
of the past republics. She needs the confederation
of modern democracy, and, when once aroused, must
be early directed to the true object. The Italian who
spends his power, his wealth and his influence in
attempts to restore the ancient confederacy is like
the man who starts westward at evening to overtake
the departed sun. But the Italian who, roused to a
proper sense of the capability of his country, determines
to secure to her the best good that other nations
now enjoy, is like the man who, starting at dawn,
proceeds in an easterly course to meet the sun in his
rising. There is a necessity laid upon both&mdash;failure
is certain for the former, success inevitable to the
latter.</p>

<p>We give more space to the changes and the condition
of the Papal States than to the circumstances
of other kingdoms of Europe, because the double
power exercised there makes any change interesting,
and the extended influence of the spiritual supremacy
gives proportionate consequence to any movement
or event that disturbs the dominancy of the Bishop
of Rome. Indeed so deeply interesting is the whole
state of Italy, taking its present movement in connection
with its past history, that a whole article<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
might be profitably devoted to a consideration of its
past grandeur, its present distressed condition, and its
means and hopes of future restoration. We may in
some future number take up the subject.</p>

<p>The peninsula containing the kingdoms of Portugal
and Spain has been in constant agitation for the
past year&mdash;but so trifling are the relations of Portugal
that very little interest is felt in her convulsions,
and few pause to inquire which party or faction
is uppermost at the latest dates. Spain has
had her semi-revolutions, but as yet they have produced
little good to the people beyond the weakening
of the power or influence of the rulers; so that when
the people shall really rise, they will have less
weight to keep them down&mdash;less power to resist&mdash;less
of obstruction to overcome. But the energies
of Spain seem to be on a revival, and there are
hopes, founded on existing recent improvement, that
this abundant providence on behalf of that country
will not be much longer neglected by the people, but
that from one effort to another they will rise to that
rank in the scale of nations to which the kingdom is
entitled, and of which the attempt to go beyond deprived
her.</p>

<p>Poor Portugal! She will linger yet, and perhaps
be absorbed. Her independent existence is not of
sufficient consequence to the world to induce an
effort on her behalf; and England, now that France
must relinquish her claims on Spain, can afford to
withdraw her patronage from Portugal&mdash;if, indeed,
we may not rather say that in the present disturbed
and crumbling state of European monarchies, neither
England nor any other kingdom will feel that she has
much superflux of power to shake to any decaying
state.</p>

<p>Portugal was once an integral portion of Spain,
and she may again be in union with her sister. The
mountains that interpose need no longer make enemies
of these two small states, and the common wants
and common weakness of both should and will induce
them "like kindred drops to mingle into one."
The language of Portugal differs from that of Spain
considerably, but almost every Portuguese speaks
Spanish, and the literature of Spain is in a great
measure that of Portugal, as that of Great Britain is
shared by the United States.</p>

<p>Portugal and Spain are both deriving the means of
true strength by the diminution of their colonial possessions,
and when they have recovered from the
shock which the exercise of power over distant dependent
states is almost sure to bring, they may,
united, have an important rank with the European
powers.</p>

<p>Terrible has been the oppression of rulers in some
parts of Germany. That oppression has not trodden
<i>out</i>, though it may have trodden <i>down</i>, the spirit of
men. And even in Austria the awakening power
has been felt within the present year&mdash;felt to the agitation
of national councils&mdash;to the terror and flight
of rulers. It is perhaps a subject for joy rather than
regret, that the movements of the people have been
less radical than in some other countries. This is,
after all, the true way. Grasping at more than they
can retain, a rising people lose what might have been
of service. The lesson of France in her revolution
in the last century was not lost on Germany, and the
people demanded of their rulers that which might be
granted without the disturbance of order; and then
they were content with what they received, because
it was at once a proof that asking they could receive,
and receiving they could learn to enjoy.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia, in reply to the demands of
the people, yielded some points, and then drew their
attention to a long-cherished idea of a confederation
of the German States, by which the differences of the
several powers should be settled by an accredited
tribunal, and a species of federal government be
established to watch over those rights conceded by
the individual states to the federal power.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the King of Prussia should
have found occasion in these trying times to provoke
war with Denmark, upon a claim by Schleswig for
protection, and that claim rests upon the poor plea
that&mdash;though really a <i>dependence</i> of Denmark&mdash;Schleswig
is not of Scandinavian origin, like Denmark,
and therefore is anxious to maintain her German
relations. The Scandinavian blood runs through
the veins of Sweden and Russia as well as those of
Denmark, and "will protect itself," if not now, at
least when a better opportunity occurs.</p>

<p>The union of the various <i>States</i> of Germany proposed
by the King of Prussia has been formed, and
Arch-Duke John has been elected "<span class="smcap">Vicar</span> of the
German Empire." He is a man of enlarged views,
of liberal political principles. He is a relation (an
uncle) of the Emperor of Austria. He was the representative
of the emperor in the German Diet, and his
substitute during his (the emperor's) absence from
his capital.</p>

<p>This new organization of the German powers looks
to the establishment of a common army, and the creation
and maintenance of a common navy; and the
attempt to produce these means and evidences of
power <i>may</i> create new disturbances, as they are
costly to support, and often dangerous to their supporters.</p>

<p>Austria, to which we have already alluded, felt the
common <i>throe</i> and manifested the general alarm.
The vigilance of a jealous government had spread over
the whole empire an appearance of tranquillity, but
the first symptom of popular movement abroad roused
the Austrians to an annunciation of their own wrongs,
(they did not comprehend their <i>rights</i>,) and as they
felt most directly the arm of the Prince Metternich,
the tyrannical and efficient minister of the emperor,
they demanded his dismissal; they assaulted his
castle of Johannisburg; they destroyed it and wasted
the palatable contents of its cellars&mdash;stores of many
years collection of the wine that bears the name of
its place of deposit.</p>

<p>In the mean time the people of Hungary, and those
of Bohemia, which had come to be dependencies upon
the crown, demanded <i>their</i> rights as nations. It is
remarkable of the movement in Hungary, that though
the people of that government had enjoyed privileges
unknown to any other subjects of the Austrian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Emperor, yet they were the first to demand further
concessions; a proof this that the great agitation in
Europe is not the sudden action of an oppressed
people. If it were, it would be greatest and most
<i>exigeant</i> where the oppression was the most intolerable:
but the earliest and the most thorough opposition,
and the most effective insurrections have been
where the hand of power was most lenient, and the
civil privileges of the people were the greatest; a
proof that the whole revolutionary movements in
Europe have been caused by a prevailing sense of
human rights, rather than a feeling of the people's
wrongs; that the mind of man is rising to the assertion
of its own dignity, and is hastening forward to
the fulfillment of its own destiny; it is not content
with toleration, it demands an acknowledgment of
freedom; and whatever restrains beyond the necessity
of government&mdash;of self-government&mdash;is regarded
as an infringement of rights; and the more delicate
the perception, the greater is the intolerance of the
wrong.</p>

<p>Austria proper has made a strong and a long stride
toward <i>freedom</i>. Comparatively she is yet in the
dark, but her face is set toward the coming light, and
year after year will show her progress toward it, and
the effect of that light upon her institutions. It is now
too late for tyrants to doubt that their true interests
will be found in graceful, moderate concessions; to
<i>give</i> a little, rather than to have much <i>taken</i>; and
with all the restlessness of the people, they seem to
be disposed to remain content with a moderate progress
of improvement; but wo to those who would
stay the motion of that to which the spirit of the
age has imparted the means of progress.</p>

<p>The spirit of revolution has been rife along the
shores of the Danube, and the numerous states, provinces,
and dependencies, that lie toward the Black
Sea, have formed alliances, and will assert their
rights.</p>

<p>The city of Prague, famous in story and in song,
has been laid in ashes, as a punishment for its oppugnation
against the emperor; but the ashes of a favorite
city may be as powerful a stimulant to the
spirit of injured man as to the best portion of the
vegetable world&mdash;and power may find itself injured
by a conflagration as well as its dependence.</p>

<p>Russia, amidst all this confusion among the nations
of the Continent, has been able to maintain her apparent
quiet. But she has felt that the experience of
Austria was soon to be understood by herself; and
when light should have pierced into the almost impervious
recesses of that kingdom, her subjects would
be able to discover not only the chains upon their
limbs, but those who placed them there. Her time
is at hand. She may yield, but the empire is too
large to be conciliated by concessions. Interest and
feeling are opposite, and it is probable that the only
point upon which the whole can agree will be that of
immitigable hostility to the ruling powers. She will
attempt to seize upon the revolted provinces of other
powers, and jeopard her central position by the
miserable attempt to keep truth and its enjoyment
from the extremities.</p>

<p>Great Britain has had her share in the difficulties
which have disturbed and convulsed her continental
neighbors. She has had in her midst a party of ultras,
called Chartists, that look to the subversion of the
present form of government. She has dealt with
them steadily, sternly, and, for a time, effectually;
but while there is oppression almost necessarily in a
form of government, there will be a place for opposition
to stand upon, and that opposition will assume
any form which can promote its object.</p>

<p>England, of all nations of Europe, seems to have
understood the advantage of concession. She has
denied, postponed, hesitated, and then granted, so
that the joy caused by the concession has for a time
disarmed opposition, and given new strength, or at
least additional <i>time</i> to the government. She has
yielded slowly, but still yielding from time to time
what has been asked of the government in behalf of
the people, when the power of the government and
the peace of the realm were not involved. And she
has overwhelmed with power or ridicule all attempts
at subverting the monarchy. The Radicals have
been shot down as at Manchester; the Chartists
ridiculed into silence; but Catholic emancipation has
been allowed, and the corn-laws repealed.</p>

<p>But let no one suppose that the results of force, of
ridicule, or concession are to be the yielding of the
public; the same spirit which called into action all
those opposing means, is as constantly at work now
as it was ten years ago, and the demands will be as
regular and as imperative as ever, until the last
vestige of inequality shall have disappeared. Happy
will it be for Great Britain if her ministry, practicing
the wisdom of the past, allows concession to prevent
revolution, and permits what of monarchy and aristocracy
is left, to come easily to the ground rather
than to be upturned by the violence of insurrection.
England, for many years, has been as much in a
state of revolution as has France. She has had fewer
convulsions, but she has made a steady progress in
her orbit, and those who live out the century, will
see the end of one grand cycle.</p>

<p>Ireland has been made to occupy a large portion
of the public eye this year. The death of O'Connell
seemed to have left the "repeal party," (nearly the
whole nation,) without a leader. Certainly without
a sage adviser; and the great measures which that
distinguished man had so long lead, was likely to be
lost by the apathy of one section, or the rash zeal of
the other. That Ireland has been badly ruled by
England, ever since its conquest, is an historical fact;
that the efforts toward redress have usually resulted
in worse than failure, is known. But the prudence
of O'Connell seemed to promise as favorable results
to the <i>repeal</i> question, (reasonably considered,) as
they had wrought in favor of emancipation. He had
age, talents, learning, experience, prudence, fore-sight;
he knew when to withdraw and when to press
his claims; he could not, of course, please all who
desired the same object with him, because all could
not comprehend the powerful effect of prudent restraint,
or, as a southern statesman says, of "masterly
inactivity." And his death allowed those of more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
zeal but less discretion to obtain an influence which
he once possessed; and Ireland is now plunged into
the miseries of a <i>civil</i> war.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the power of private feelings,
our intention is to refer to the insurrectionary movements
in Ireland as to those of other countries,
namely, as the consequence of the growing sense of
human rights, and as that sense must increase, must
constantly augment, it is impossible that Ireland can
remain in the same situation in which she has been
kept. It is known, however, that a galling sense of
wrong stimulates the Irish; that it is not the ordinary
effects of an oppressive government that produces
rebellion, but injury that extends to the domestic
hearth, injury that strikes at the rights of conscience,
injury that makes even the wise man mad. The end
is not yet.</p>

<p>All is quiet in Holland and Belgium; and all is
awaiting the melioration which time and wisdom must
bring.</p>

<p>This year has seen the close of the Mexican War,
in which our army gained fame, and our nation
gained territory. And now the great question is as
to the uses of that territory, and the character of the
institutions that are to be granted to these new acquisitions
soon to become sovereignties. We do not
mean to take any share in what may be considered
the party politics of the country; but we may allude
<i>historically</i> to measures as well as to events, and
therefore we are at liberty to say, that the question
now pressed upon the people of the United States by
the acquisition of new territory, is that of the extension
of the institution of slavery. Shall the new
<i>territories</i> be allowed by Congress to authorize
slavery within their borders? and on that question
there is much feeling, and before it can be settled
there must of necessity be more, inasmuch as it has
now become one of the elements of party movements&mdash;not
merely a question <i>in</i> the presidential canvass,
but absolutely one on which a party stands, and on
which it nominated a president, nominated not merely
a nominal candidate, but one who, having held the
office once, had acquired distinction, and having
manifested interest in all public measures since, had
maintained that distinction, and was a <i>real</i> candidate.
The sooner this question is settled the <i>better</i>; and the
better it is settled, the more for the peace and the
dignity of the nation.</p>

<p>To this question, which has in some respect, also,
assumed one of local distinction, we will not further
refer; it is one that will agitate until settled, and
being settled, will no more disturb.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to place before our readers
an array of political facts, nor to make out a chronological
table for the year now drawing to a close.
It would be better at once to refer the reader to the
easily accessible columns of the daily papers, which
have really been crowded with statements of convulsed
states, and revolutionized governments. It
has not been a question with them as to commercial
changes, the fluctuations of a market, or the variation
of stocks; but they have had to record the fate
of kingdoms, and the flight or concession of kings
and emperors. And we write necessarily so much
in advance of printing, that our quarter of the globe
might change its rulers between our pen and the
type of our compositor.</p>

<p>We have been content to notice some of the most
exciting movements in Europe, without pretending
to write their termination. We see in some kingdoms
the freshness of new institutions, and in others
the renewal of contests which had been deemed
closed forever; where power has had its heels upon
the neck of the people for centuries, there are tokens
of <i>turning</i>; and from all this we learn that there is
a spirit in the mind of man, and that, in spite of all
attempts to crush that spirit, or to darken it, the inspiration
of the Most High is giving it understanding,
and it is asserting its high prerogative, doing justice
to its lofty teachings.</p>

<p>How will all these things abroad affect us here?
What will be the influence upon the United States
of these revolutionary movements in Europe?</p>

<p>The effect is now being felt; it is only to calculate
the increasing power to understand the augmentation
of results. Rapidly and more rapidly will the number
of inhabitants be increased; the amount of wealth
will be more than proportionably great, because not
only will not immigration be limited to the poor, but
those of the rich who <i>cannot</i> come, will send hither
their hoarded means, for safety; so that while the
abundance of our fields shall make us "the exhaustless
granary of the world," the permanence of our
institutions shall make us the depository of European
wealth.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether our own country may not
be exposed to the very convulsions which make European
nations so unstable. We answer, no; agitation
may occur here, and momentary excitement lead to
fear of local violence, but he who strikes here, strikes
at himself. The very nature of our institutions are
such as to make it the interest of all to sustain them,
and the very causes which operate to the disturbance
of society in other countries, can have no existence
here, or if they exist, they have nothing to act upon,
that evil effects may result.</p>

<p>In Europe, a majority of the people are deprived
of their rights, are made to yield to the dictation of a
small minority, and sustain others whom they do not
like, with their own industry. They must submit to
laws which they do not approve, or submit to the
charge of treason for their attempts to resist, that they
may change their laws. In this country, whenever
a majority is satisfied that certain measures are inconsistent
with their own good, they may instruct their
law-makers to change the enactments, or they can
change the law-makers. This is the <i>theory</i> and this
the actual <i>practice</i> of our government.</p>

<p>The people of Europe find the means of living
unequally divided. There is less of a surplus, as it
regards the <i>whole</i>, than for a <i>part</i>; and while the
few abound in all that is desirable, nay, with the
superfluities of life, the many lack the necessaries of
wholesome existence. And this is the result of
their institutions&mdash;a result which no convulsion, no
revolution can at once change&mdash;so many centuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
have passed over the abuses, that not only are they prescriptive,
but there does not seem in the people any
knowledge to apply the power they may attain, to any
<i>immediate</i> remedy of the evil.</p>

<p>With the United States there is no system to change&mdash;no
institution to be remodeled; of course, every
year works some change in the operation of the
system, and makes more and more beneficial the
institutions of the country. The new views of man's
importance and of human rights, which work out revolutions
in Europe, only make our citizens cling
close and closer to the institutions of their own
country. While blood is poured out like water in
Paris to change the rulers of the people, the rulers
of this country are changed with a quiet that would
denote almost indifference. Men talk of an exciting
<i>contest</i> for the presidential chair; but analyze that
contest, and it is found to be only a newspaper discussion
of the merits of certain existing or proposed
acts of Congress, having nothing to do with the
organic laws of the land, or with the form of government;
the contest or discussion was closed on the
7th day of November last, and men scarcely remember
the earnestness of the newspaper paragraphs, or
the stump speeches.</p>

<p>Broad and expanded are the views of a true Republic;
there can be no narrowness in the institution&mdash;it
is for all men, and for all times; and never since
the first gathering of people into a political body was
there such a foundation for national greatness and
diffused individual happiness, as is laid in this country.
Wealth, true wealth, the means of general comfort,
abounds. A variety of climate ensures the produce
of almost every section of the world, and the right
to cultivate a portion, gives to all the means of enjoyment;
there can never be in this country (without
a special visitation of Providence,) real want among
any considerable number.</p>

<p>We have over twenty millions of inhabitants, and
raise more than a thousand million bushels of grain,
and one hundred million bushels of potatoes. With
these means to be multiplied indefinitely, and a free
mind, what has America to fear?</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to make a eulogy upon our
country, or to anticipate the great results from the
full operation of our system of government with the
immense natural advantages which we possess. But
we may remark, that with the progress of civil
freedom in this country has been the diffusion of
morals and piety; and with the enjoyment of political
advantage, have been the enlargement of social
delights, and the augmentation of domestic happiness.
Woman has found her rank in the scale of existence,
and enjoys that eminence in refined estimation which
the delicacy of her feelings, the purity of her sentiment,
and the intensity of her affections demand.
And every where her influence is felt, in the melioration
of the public mind, as in the limited circle at
the home fire-side. Nay, it is <i>from</i> the fire-side that
the circle of her influence expands, and she is respected
abroad as she is loved at home. This is one
of the results of the free institutions of this country;
and while it is seen now as a result, it will be felt
hereafter as one of the powerfully operating causes
of constantly increasing human freedom and human
happiness.</p>

<p>How beautiful the thought, that she who is the
light of our hearts and our homes is becoming the
blessing of our country; and that not less than
domestic delight is political freedom to be derived
from the sanctifying influences of woman's gentleness
and woman's purity.</p>

<h3>OR THE NEW MINISTER.</h3>

<hr class="short" />
<h4>BY MRS. E. C. KINNEY.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<h5>The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. <span class="smcap">James</span> iii. 8.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> villages in the Union could exceed Green
Valley in local beauty and advantages; embosomed
in hills, embellished with trees, and watered by a
willow-shaded stream that meandered through its
centre. Situated, too, within twenty miles of the
great emporium, and skirted by a railway leading to
it, the cultivators of a soil, that ever fulfilled more
abundantly the hopes of the husbandman, could ask
nothing more favorable to the ready disposal of their
crops. The inhabitants of Green Valley were mostly
farmers, who, besides "owing no man any thing,"
had each a comfortable dwelling and ample outhouses
of his own, nothing better than his neighbors, but
equaling theirs in the well-to-do look of the fences,
the garden and door-yard. That the village was
originally settled by Quakers, and half peopled by
this drab-coated sect at the date of our story, no
stranger needed to inquire, after passing through its
straight-cut roads, or breathing its air of purity and
quietude. Long had its simple-minded, true-hearted
people lived in the daily enjoyment of mutual kindness
and love; till contentment seemed written not
only on the broad brims of the farmers, but on the
bridles of their docile beasts, and on their very implements
of husbandry. In the course of time, other
religious denominations were established in Green
Valley; but as the descendants of Penn continued to
"work in quietness and eat their own bread,"
strangers intermeddled not with them; while the
savor of their peaceful spirits seemed so diffused
among other sects, that all "agreed to disagree" with
one another, and for years unbroken harmony was
the result. But <i>we</i> have only to do with the Congregational
church of Green Valley, and will forthwith
introduce the reader to the shepherd of this little
flock. Mr. Worthiman was a plain man of God&mdash;middle-aged,
of respectable scholastic attainments,
and one who, for his sound judgment and exemplary
"walk and conversation," had ever a "good report
of them that were without." The law of kindness
dwelt in his heart and on his lips, and in all the
offices of exemplar, teacher and comforter of his
charge none was more worthy than he. The church
at its earliest organization, without a dissenting voice,
invited Mr. Worthiman to become its pastor&mdash;his
prayer dedicated the house of worship, and each
succeeding Sabbath for a series of years found him
at his post, breaking the Bread of Life to a grateful,
confiding people. Nor were his pastoral duties less
regularly fulfilled: One afternoon of every week
was devoted by himself and his wife (whose living
example was "such as becometh woman possessing
godliness,") to visiting in rotation the families of his
congregation; and so well timed was this custom,
that the farmers' wives could calculate each her
honored turn to a day; so that the substantial hospitalities
of a generous board were added to the warm
welcomes of heart and hand.</p>

<p>Besides the neat parsonage reared for the minister
and his increasing family, he was, through the generosity
of his parishioners, the owner of an old-fashioned
chaise, and a horse gentle and well-ordered
as his master. These were always in requisition on
visiting afternoons; and a right comfortable sight it
was to see the minister and his wife jogging along
over the smooth roads, blessing all they passed with
the smile of true benignity, and receiving the heart's
blessing of all in return; while the good dame to
whose dwelling their course was directed, having
all things in readiness for the pastoral visitation, stationed
one of her cleanly-attired children at the window,
to watch for the first appearance of the reverend
chaise wending up the lane to the farm-house, at
which signal, with beaming eyes, the child hastened
to open the gate, dreaming in the simplicity of her
rosyhood, of no greater honor than to usher in the
respected pair. On these occasions the farmer
usually left the field, and donned his Sunday suit, the
good wife appeared in her best cap and snowy kerchief,
and the maid came from the dairy, with tidy
apron, to claim her seat in the snug parlor, that alike
they might sit under the lips that dropped wisdom
for all. Then, when they gathered around the lengthened
table, the pastor's blessing was music in their
ears, and supper being over, his elongated prayer,
comprehending the wants of each, and all, closed the
privileges of the pastor's visit. Mr. Worthiman was
equally satisfactory in his visits at the bedside of the
sick&mdash;in his consolations to the dying, and his sympathy
in the house of mourning. The aged leaned
on him for support&mdash;the middle-aged walked hand in
hand with his counsels, and the young looked up to
him for guidance; while no austerity on his part forbade
the merriment of their sports: so far from this,
it was his custom at weddings, after a salutation to
the bride, and a commendation of the bride's loaf, to
take early leave, lest his presence should restrain
the music and dancing that usually sum up a country
bridal entertainment.</p>

<p>Such <i>was</i> the pastoral position of Mr. Worthiman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and such the unmolested happiness of Green Valley!
But, alas! the serpent that looked with envious eyes
on the paradise of our first parents, was about to
creep stealthily among the vine-clad cottages of the
peaceful villagers. And as in Eden his poison first
insinuated itself through the mind of woman, so from
woman was it to be communicated to these homes
of contentment and love.</p>

<p>Among the few merchants of all-wares that had
come in to supply the growing population of Green
Valley, was a young man of more amiability than
vigor of mind, who, having lived a single but quiet
and peaceable life some years in the village, brought
unexpectedly, from a town near-by, a wife to divide
or double his blessedness. Kate Tiptop was cousin
to the young man, and did not change her name in
marrying him. She was the only daughter of parents
who lived just long enough to spoil by indulgence a
child whose native faculties of mind were more than
ordinarily vigorous and acute; such as, under a disciplinary
course of education, united with healthful
moral training, would have ripened her into the
noblest development of woman; but her first idea took
the form of self, instead of truth, and growing perception
brought only increasing self-consciousness. In
short, she had early imbibed the belief that the world in
which she moved was made for her accommodation;
and her inherent passion&mdash;love of power&mdash;became
more and more apparent as she increased in years.
Had she been beautiful in person, this might have
shown itself in more vain, but less injurious forms;
as it was, she desired to sway hearts, not to receive
their flattering unction in return, but to strengthen
and confirm her own sense of ability to do it. Love
of <i>action</i> alone induced her to engage in the practical
duties of domestic life, and she married more for the
sake of being the head of a family, than from any
motives of affection. To accomplish this desire, she
well knew that her husband must be her inferior in
mental strength; while the additional inducement
that fixed her choice on her cousin was, that in
uniting herself with him, she would not even have
to yield her name. Mrs. Tiptop soon became a
pattern-card to all housewives&mdash;always having her
work <i>done</i>, and <i>well</i> done; and never lacking time
nor tongue to entertain visiters, nor health, leisure, or
purpose to visit among the neighbors herself. She
was one of those women whose husbands are super-numeraries
at home, while their wives are mouth-pieces
for them abroad.</p>

<p>Her go-<i>aheaditiveness</i> was a new revelation to
the plodding villagers; it not only made her household
cares a mere song, but enabled her to preside
over her husband's business affairs with a dexterity
of calculation that soon rendered his own position
but a sinecure. In short, Mrs. Tiptop was a trump-card
at home, and every where, always winning the
game of domestic differences, and turning the chances
of all neighborly or church variances, which began
to spring up simultaneously with her introduction
there.</p>

<p>In person Mrs. Tiptop was tall, of slender frame,
and thin, almost to emaciation, giving no indications
of physical or mental strength, save that it was "all
in the <i>eye</i>"&mdash;black, penetrating, "wise as the serpent,"
and possessing the optical versatility of seeing
all sides in a twinkling; yet when its latent forces
were single-eyed to a purpose, that end was achieved
as unquestionably as when acknowledged by many
witnesses.</p>

<p>No sooner did that eye peer through the bridal veil
at Mr. Worthiman, on Mrs. Tiptop's introduction to
the village church, than her purpose was formed and
executed as truly as when carried out through all
the intricate passages leading to its accomplishment.</p>

<p>She had determined to be <i>felt</i> in the village, and
Mr. Worthiman's godly power over his unsophisticated
people was then and there destined to totter
from its long settled foundations. Before the next
communion season Mrs. Tiptop had sent in her certificate,
and was placed on the list of church-members.
Here was a footing on which she could stand
to use the instruments that would be needed in the
premeditated revolution. The initiation of a communicant
into a country church is generally succeeded
by a call from its officers on the new member.
Nothing could be more gracious than Mrs. Tiptop's
reception of this church police, who paid her the
complimentary visit during the week subsequent to
her admission; but in this instance, on Deacon
Heedful alone fell the <i>charm</i> of her serpentine eye.
Quick as thought in discernment, she penetrated at
once through the deacon's tractable physiognomy to
his more flexible mind; and while the good man was
inwardly congratulating his church on the acquisition
of so worthy a member, she was fastening around
him the toils in which he was hereafter to do her
bidding, as willingly as the dray-horse works in the
harness. Deacon Heedful belonged to that small
minority of human beings who know nothing of
double-meanings or double-dealings; pure in himself,
he was the embodiment of that "charity that thinketh
no evil" of others; but, unfortunately, of stronger
heart than head. Perhaps an innate sense of this
<i>crowning</i> weakness made him lend a more ready
ear to the suggestions of other minds; at any rate,
Mrs. Tiptop soon had him under her easy control,
through that psychological law by which superior
intellect ever governs its inferior. This accomplished,
it were unnecessary to carry the reader through the
winding ways which led her, with the deacon, to
that point where she could spread out before him the
spiritual position of Mr. Worthiman and his church,
and convince him that they were "far behind the
times." Now this was "a secret" that she had not
even communicated to her husband, but in which
she could not be mistaken, having come from a town
where all was "stirring" in the cause of religion&mdash;where
the preachers were "wide awake," and dead-level
homilies, like Mr. Worthiman's, were not tolerated;
for her part, she should soon languish under
such enervating sermons as his; and here her fears
being profusely watered by tears, began to take root
in the heart of Deacon Heedful, who gave her a
sympathetic squeeze of the hand on parting with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
one evening, and turned, poor man! to the sleepless
pillow where she had planted a thorn. He, however,
determined to deliberate some days before communicating
his fears, even to his brother officers in the
church, and never to do it, unless reflection sanctioned
Mrs. Tiptop's hints.</p>

<p>But seeds of discontent sown in one mind, are by
some Mesmeric sympathy conveyed into another,
and <i>another</i>, till a rapid, wide-spread growth is the
unlooked for consequence; yet Mrs. Tiptop waited
for another visit from the deacon, before breaking
the subject to any one else, even to "dear Mr.
Tiptop;" so <i>she</i> was not to blame for the disaffection
that was springing up around her. Deacon Heedful
arrived even sooner than she had anticipated&mdash;and
most <i>unexpected</i> to her was his account of the spreading
influence that had so <i>mysteriously</i> come to light.
The deacon's doubts were now matured into a strong
sense of duty, and, to the complete satisfaction of
Mrs. Tiptop, he had decided to take a <i>stand</i> in the
matter.</p>

<p>The only proposition she made was that the leading
clergyman of her native town should be invited to
exchange one Sabbath with Mr. Worthiman. This
he promised should be effected, and took his leave
for the purpose. As the parsonage was in his way
home, he called to pay his respects to his minister,
whom he found confined to the house by an indisposition
that would prevent his preaching the following
Sabbath; so he requested the deacon to read
a sermon, as usual under such circumstances. This
was opportune for proposing to call in the aid of a
neighboring minister, which Mr. Worthiman acceding
to, the matter was soon arranged, and word given
out through the village that Mr. Newlight would fill
the pulpit the coming Sabbath.</p>

<p>Providence, or <i>some</i> invisible agent, seemed on
the side of Mrs. Tiptop, under the inspiration of
which she went from house to house, promising the
parishioners a treat new to them from Mr. Worthiman's
pulpit.</p>

<p>The Sabbath was an anxious one to her, and an
eventful one in the Congregational church of Green
Valley; the spirit-stirring tones of Mr. Newlight's
voice&mdash;his forceful manner, and novel forms of presenting
old truths, had such an electric effect upon
his audience that Mrs. Tiptop's eyes drank their fill
of satisfaction, and gratified ambition began to revel
in her brain. Nothing was talked of the succeeding
day but Mr. Newlight's great sermon; and wishes
were openly expressed, mostly by the younger members
of the congregation, that Mr. Worthiman was
more like him. Dissatisfaction spread like an infectious
disease, and before the year expired, a meeting
had been called to confer on the subject&mdash;the
church was divided against itself, and the iron had
entered the soul of poor Mr. Worthiman. But the
oldest and best of his people, those who had been the
pillars of the church, were not to be so easily moved
out of place, and the result was, that the disaffected
members&mdash;including at least one half&mdash;immigrated in
a body, under the lead of Deacon Heedful and Mrs.
Tiptop; were formed into another church, built a
modern house of worship, and called a new-school
minister to fill its pulpit.</p>

<p>Mr. Lion was a man of strong sense, strong principle,
and strong will. His wife was an English
lady of family and attainments, who, under the influence
of a fervid attachment, had left a high-born
circle of friends in her native land, to share the lot
of an humble American clergyman, when too young
to have attained that maturity of good-breeding which
accommodates itself, without apparent effort, to the
accidents and diversities of society. Having few attributes
of mind, and no tastes in common with the
secluded inhabitants of Green Valley, but possessing
a kind heart and an amiable temper, she endeavored
to conform, so far as native refinement would permit,
to the habits and wishes of her husband's pastoral
charge.</p>

<p>For the first six months succeeding Mr. Lion's installation
the triumph of the immigrants seemed complete.
Deacon Heedful was reappointed to the office
he held under Mr. Worthiman's ministration, and
Mrs. Tiptop assumed her undisputed place of honor
next to the minister's wife&mdash;introduced a maternal
association, and a female prayer-meeting among the
women of the congregation, in the exercises of which
she invariably took the lead, and made herself so
<i>prominently</i> useful, that Deacon Heedful often
prayed that she might live to be "a mother in Israel."
Even the spirit of discord for a time appeared to be
exorcised from their midst, while admiration of the
new minister and his lovely wife was the absorbing
passion of the day.</p>

<p>But the evil spirit that had built the church was not
long to be denied his right to a place in it, and before
many months began to show himself in various forms
and guises. First, there arose an indistinct murmur
that Mr. Lion did not visit his people familiarly and
often enough; nor did he make pastoral tea-visits
with his wife, as was Mr. Worthiman's custom.
Then a whisper was heard that Mrs. Lion seemed to
consider herself of "better flesh and blood" than
others; that even Mrs. Tiptop wasn't a confidential
friend of hers; but they guessed her piety was no
better than theirs, by the fashionable way in which
she dressed. Then, the new minister and his wife
cared more for each other than they did for their
parishioners, as they frequently walked out together
without stopping to call on any of them. Thus, in
various quarters, discontent began to show itself, and
somehow or other could always be traced back to
Mrs. Tiptop, who evidently felt chagrined at not
being invited to share the secrets of Mrs. Lion's
household.</p>

<p>But now an unlooked for arrival at the new
minister's gave fresh impulse and direction to the
evil genius of Green Valley. The new-comer was
a sister of Mrs. Lion's, just from England, who, it
was understood, would be a future inmate of the
family. Miss May proved to have the <i>disadvantages</i>,
in the eyes of the village belles, of beauty,
accomplishments, and independence of mind and
purse. Brought up, and having just completed her
education in the city of London, she was now a bird<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
let loose in the free air of the country, whither she had
been drawn by affection for her sister, and a desire,
not unmingled with romance, to see the land of
liberty, and exult in the freedom of its rural scenes.
And exult she <i>did</i>&mdash;now in the woods and fields
gathering wild-flowers, and now, mounted on her
English pony, galloping over the hills and away&mdash;the
villagers said, "none knew where"&mdash;the stared-at
of all starers, if not "the admired of all admirers."
Though Miss May was sweet enough to savor all the
village with amiability, and musical enough to harmonize
the whole, the venom of the serpent made
her sweetness gall to the senses of her brother's
envious flock, and her music was discord in their ears.</p>

<p>One morning, as Miss May was riding rapidly over
a bridge, her pony stumbled on a loose plank and
threw her over his head so violently, that she was
taken up senseless by a miller who lived on the
stream, and conveyed into his humble abode, where
the good man committed her to the care of his wife,
while he went for the doctor. Now the village
physician, who was a middle-aged, married man, had
a bachelor brother connected with him, who was the
envy of the village beaux for his gentlemanly air and
good looks, <i>he</i> it was who, in this instance, hastened
to answer the urgent call of the miller. Dr. Mannerly,
on his arrival, found Miss May recovering
from her unconsciousness, and quite alarmed at
seeing herself in such strange circumstances; but his
gentleness, joined with the homely manifestations of
kindness and concern on the part of the miller and
his wife, soon composed her mind, and after the
doctor had taken some blood from her beautiful arm,
she was enabled to rise and receive his assurance
that she had sustained no very serious injury by the
fall. Being, however, too much bruised to mount
her pony again, she accepted the doctor's polite
offer to take her home in his buggy.</p>

<p>Before night Miss May's adventure was the gossip
of the village; especially her ride homeward with
the doctor, who was observed to look uncommonly
interested, and to be engaged in earnest conversation
with his fair companion; nor did it escape the vigilant
eye of Mrs. Tiptop that the doctor's buggy stood
at the minister's gate every day for a week thereafter,
and longer each successive time than <i>she</i>
thought necessary for a professional call. And then,
when Miss May appeared again on her pony, Dr.
Mannerly was by her side, on his own high-mettled
horse, (the doctor never rode a <i>tame</i> animal, nor perpetrated
a tame remark;) this happened, too, again
and again, so that it was soon a settled matter that
Miss May and the doctor would be a match.</p>

<p>In the course of a few months, an unusual stir was
apparent at the new minister's; the blinds were
thrown open in the east parlor, and people were seen
bustling through the hall as if in preparation for some
important event. As Mr. Lion never received "donation
visits," as the custom is with village-ministers,
the bustle meant nothing less than Miss May's wedding&mdash;and
for once, the gossip had some foundation
in truth.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon a handsome carriage drove
up to the house, from which alighted a foreign-looking
gentleman, of some twenty-five years, who was pronounced
to be an English acquaintance of Mrs.
Lion's who had been invited to the wedding. And
a wedding, true enough, it was, for Dr. Mannerly
came hurrying along toward the minister's about
dark, equipped from top to toe, and wearing the
white vest that decided him to be the happy man.
And now the uninvited multitude envied the very
lights that made brilliant "the east room," and no
language could express their mortification, when
the honest chaise of Mr. Worthiman dropped himself
and wife at the new minister's door.</p>

<p>But a greater surprise awaited them the following
morning, when the carriage that brought the Englishman
to the village, was seen rolling rapidly away,
and in it, seated by the stranger, was the heroine of
all their surmises.</p>

<p>The doctor visited his patients as usual on that
day, and the village newspaper announced the
marriage, at Green Valley, of Sir Edward Sterling,
of London, England, to Miss Rosina May, of the
same metropolis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiptop and her followers were dumb-founded!
But the evil genius, paralyzed for the
time, revived ere long again with fresh vigor, and
became so vexatious to Mr. and Mrs. Lion, that a
dismissal was asked for and obtained from the
Second Congregational Church of Green Valley,
which, at the last accounts, was about calling a <span class="smcap">NEW
MINISTER</span>.</p>

<span class="i0">A realm of forest, hill and lake I sing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beneath the "Empire State's" protecting wing;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But this much I will say; it bears the name<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of a brave warrior, who, in times of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst through the forests like a flood of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And on the savage foe deep vengeance told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well that warrior kept unstained the wreath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reaped by his sword in fields of blood and death.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within this realm Dame Nature's mantle wide<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here tower the hill-tops in their forest pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There smile the sylvan valleys, though the soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is such, in truth, no wonder people chose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave Dame Nature to her wild repose.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet pleasant are the sights and sounds when Summer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wakens the forest depths to light and life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodpecker, a red-plumed, noisy drummer,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Times to the thrasher's clearly flourished fife;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Of the quick squirrel as it glides across;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, glancing like a vision to the eye,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fancy your wearied foot has clambered now<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Delaware's steep hill, and then glance back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid sight will put you in a glow!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There winds the river in its snake-like track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst rural beauty laughs upon your view&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meadows of green, and fields of golden hue,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then White Lake, expanding far away!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, its pure waters gleam before me now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sheds upon my world-worn heart a ray<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bright as the crystal beauty of its brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loveliest of lakes! this pulse must cease to beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I forget thee, beautiful and sweet!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">M., too, (the village,) is a lovely place,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Nature and Art at every point are seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brimmed is it with good fellows, and those pearls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of man's prosaic being&mdash;witching girls.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet there are places in this rising county<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where travelers merit an especial bounty<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For perseverance, where the starving crow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(But these things in strict confidence I write.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The earth is sprinkled with a scanty growth<br /></span>

<span class="i1">To show its surly head&mdash;while grim and bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghosts of former trees their mossy locks<br /></span>

<h4>BY CAROLINE C&mdash;&mdash;.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<p>What shall I write about? A sensible question
enough for me to address to you, good reader, were
I a worn-out school-girl, with a mind quite like an
"exhausted receiver" on the one subject, frightful,
dismal, and hated at all times to <i>her</i>. But, thanks be
to Time, I am <i>no</i> school-girl&mdash;and it is rather a
foolish question, this same one I have proposed,
considering that for sixty long seconds my mind has
been fully determined as to <i>what</i> I will write about
this morning.</p>

<p>I have been looking over a file of old magazines,
which are now scattered about me in most beautiful
confusion, for the sole purpose of discovering in the
steps of <i>how many</i> "illustrious predecessors" I am
to follow, when I expatiate on that, which, by the
last tale in the last new magazine, seems to be still a
marvelous object in creation, namely, "<i>The Coquette</i>."</p>

<p>And oh the poems, and tales, and essays, by the
Mrs.'s and Misses&mdash;the Mr.'s and Esqr.'s, let alone
the Dr.'s and Rev.'s, who have not disdained to pour
forth their thoughts like water on this exhausted (?)
topic! I will spare you, through mere Christian
charity, dear reader, from listening to their enumeration.</p>

<p>By this time, if you are any thing of a magazine or
newspaper reader, you must <i>necessarily</i> have arrived
at some conclusion as to this tribe of humans. Well,
what do you think of coquettes <i>in general</i>, my
friend&mdash;what do you think of those with whom you
have had to do with <i>in particular</i>? According to
Johnson, a coquette is "a gay, airy girl, who by
various <i>arts</i> endeavors to gain admirers." Natural
enough, all that, <i>I</i> should say.</p>

<p>When women are blessed (?) by a kind Providence
with beauty, does it not follow rapidly on the heels
of the truth, that they are meant and made to be admired,
and loved, and wooed by the gender masculine?
And when the admiration and homage of
men's hearts are offered at the shrine of beauty&mdash;and
the favored fair one tastes the cup of adulation man
<i>forces</i> to her lips, say, ye wise ones! is there any
thing so very <i>unnatural</i> in the fact that her human
heart cries "more?" Why, even that poor, miserable
daughter of the horse-leech was not content with
saying "give!" once, it must needs be "give&mdash;<i>give</i>!"</p>

<p>Now, in all fairness, I put the question to you&mdash;what
warrior, after a brilliant achievement in <i>one</i>
battle&mdash;after one glorious conquest over his foes,
was content ever after to dwell in a quiet obscurity,
and suffer his name to be at last almost forgotten by
men, because of his very inaction? Tell me, was
that shining light so often lit and re-lit on the Mountain
of Warning for the benefit of the sojourners in
the vallies of the world&mdash;I mean Napoleon Bonaparte?
Was Cortes? Was Alexander?</p>

<p>What <i>author</i>, after writing <i>one</i> book that took the
reading world by storm, ever after that blessed day
laid down his pen and said, "I have done." Did any
of those glorious beings who, with their death-stiffened
fingers <i>can</i> write for us no more? Are the
writers of <i>our</i> day satisfied with <i>one</i> brilliant and
successful effort in the field of literary labor? Bear
witness, oh, Bulwer, and Dickens, and Cooper, and
James, to the absurdity of <i>such</i> an idea! Wait&mdash;I
would be truthful&mdash;even as I write there comes before
me a bright remembrance of <i>one</i> glorious bard, living,
voiceless <i>now</i>&mdash;our own well-beloved Halleck; but
even <i>he</i> may awake, and speak yet&mdash;and so make
way with <i>the</i> exception to my rule.</p>

<p>And what does the warrior battle for? Tell it not
in this wise, wide-awake century it is all <i>for country
and the good of man</i>! We are a wise people, <span class="smcap">WE</span>!
Such humbugging is too ancient. Say out plainly it
is for glory, for distinction, for place in the higher
room, and we will honor you for your honest words!
And what does the author labor and strive for, through
dreary days and sleepless nights? Is it for the
enlightenment of mankind&mdash;the improvement of his
fellows? Who will say that <i>this</i> is not oftenest, when
indeed it is thought of at all, the <i>secondary</i> consideration?
Ay, yes! there are such things as poor
misguided scribblers dipping their pens in their life-blood,
wherewith to leave a mark on the pages of
time, "to be seen of men!" There <i>is</i> such a thing
as a "lord of creation," <i>pining</i> for distinction, and
braving every distress, and even death, for&mdash;Fame!
Yes, we have records of sons of Genius who have
<i>died</i> because men recognized not the light <i>they</i> set
before them. I mind me, and I "weep for Adonais!
he is dead."</p>

<p>I tell you, among men it is rare to find one who,
after he has tasted the honey of applause and world-admiration,
but will taste, and continue to taste, until
he has cloyed himself, and almost (I do not <i>say</i> quite)
sickened the patient bystanders.</p>

<p>Is there, then, any thing wonderful in the fact that
woman loves admiration? With such noble examples
before her, why should she not? I know it has
been hinted broadly that it is heartless, and selfish,
and sinful, in a woman, merely for her personal
gratification, to make wrecks of the hearts of men(!!)
and that coquetting is set down among masculines
in the catalogue of sins as one of the blackest dye.
But, if man, in his wonderful wisdom, can suffer
himself to be so fooled, pray whose fault or sin is it?
If he rests his happiness on the smiles of <i>one</i> woman,
which is a rarer thing than ye think, oh, maidens!
whom shall he blame, if the smile does not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
await him? Whose fault is it if he does not <i>continue</i>
to please, when the eyes of the fair one are awakened
to his numberless "short comings?" And some day
when a more favored one of nature draws near with
his homage, why should the old lover listen in amaze
to cold words and colder sentiments? Trust me, if
men would only apply to this subject of our consideration
one iota of the coolness and calmness of
unprejudiced thought which distinguishes many of
their other musings, they might some day come to a
just conclusion.</p>

<p>But enough of this; I have given a <i>preface</i>&mdash;and I
know a case in point&mdash;more satisfactory than all <i>my</i>
arguments I think it will prove; and I imagine it will
clear me from all suspicion, or charge, if you should
prefer it against me, of entertaining wrong opinions
on this important subject.</p>

<p>From a far longer time since than I can well remember,
till within two years past, the Cleveland
family were our next door neighbors. Florence, the
eldest daughter, was a very dear friend of mine, and
I would not make her the heroine of this story to-day,
were it not for the following fact. Two years ago the
whole family emigrated to Wisconsin; and now that
they are gone so very far "out of the world," I think
no blame should be attached to me for giving her
"experience" to the good public. Sure am I, that
buried as she is in the backwoods, she will never
know that <i>I</i> have seized upon her as a "subject"
whereabout to expatiate. But if you should chance
to meet Florence in your wanderings, reader, do
not, I pray you, wound her feelings, by touching on
this topic.</p>

<p>Every body said Flory was a coquette&mdash;and adopting
as a settled point the sentiment that "what
every body says <i>must</i> be true," I suppose she was;
that is, she was "a gay, airy girl, who was fond of
admiration;" and I will not deny that she may have
exerted herself the least bit in the world to obtain it.
But I do repel most indignantly the idea that <i>she</i> was
artful and designing, or that she ever regularly <i>set a
trap</i> to ensnare any human heart.</p>

<p>Florence, when she parted from us, was of middle
height, very fair, and her cheeks wore the bloom of
early roses; her hair was of a light, glossy brown&mdash;and,
oh, those beautiful ringlets! I can vouch for the
truth of it, <i>they</i> never emerged from curl-papers&mdash;(and
by the way, how refreshing and pleasant now-a-days
it is to see any thing <i>natural</i>, even a paltry
curl!) Then her eyes, "deeply, divinely blue,"
sometimes filled with a sober, tranquil, <i>holy</i> light,
and again dancing, beaming, and running over with
joy and happiness.</p>

<p>Though Flory was the admiration of all eyes, and
"the beaux" seemed really to have no appreciation
of the presence of we poor insignificants when she
was by, yet to not many of <i>us</i> did the "green-eyed
monster" ever whisper one bad, ungracious thought
of her.</p>

<p>We all loved her&mdash;and a sadder set never waited
in our dep&ocirc;t the arrival of the eastern train, than
gathered there the day Mr. Cleveland and family
were to leave for a home in the "far West."</p>

<p>There were some, indeed, who invariably honored
Florence with the title of "coquette!" and pursed
up their lips very sanctimoniously whenever they
heard of her new conquests; particularly may this
remark apply to old Widow Forbes, who rejoiced in
the possession of four grown-up daughters&mdash;"fixtures"
most decidedly they were in her household&mdash;for
these four above-mentioned, were not in any way
remarkable for their personal attractions; and two of
them had well-nigh passed the third stage of woman's
unmarried life! But by far the greater part of the
villagers rejoiced in the presence of Florence Cleveland
as they would in a sunbeam on a dull day; she
was always so cheerful, so generous and obliging.</p>

<p>None of those sunny curls of hers were visible
the day Florence set out on her journey; perhaps
you think that was because ladies do not usually
travel with such appendages in view, and that they
were snugly packed away in the back part of her
traveling hat. But had Flory's head been uncovered
then, I fear me it would have borne terrible witness
of the desecrating hands which had been busy about
it; for the fairy-like ringlets which had so long adorned
the beautiful head, full beautiful enough without
<i>them</i>, were slumbering on the hearts of us, her
miserable, weeping cronies; and I know not how
many gentlemen's purses were freighted with like
treasure.</p>

<p>What a silent, stupid company we were gathered
there that day. It was a bright morning&mdash;there was
not a cloud to be seen in all the sky; and Susy, the
old fortune-teller, said it was a day that augured
well for their future prosperity; but that did not help
<i>us</i> any. Every body seemed to think we were to
lose one of the choicest lights of our village&mdash;and so,
indeed, we were.</p>

<p>At last the odious dep&ocirc;t-bell rung&mdash;soon after the
"fire-demon" heaved in sight, followed by its long
train of crowded cars. In ten minutes the leave-taking
was all over, our friends were seated&mdash;their
"worldly goods" were stowed away&mdash;another ring
of the bell, that never sounded half so remorselessly
before, and away they went, over the road&mdash;across
the bridge&mdash;past the burial-ground&mdash;and on&mdash;on&mdash;on!</p>

<p>To my bosom I pressed a package Florence had
given to me that morning of her departure, which
she bade me not open till she was fairly gone. I
need not tell you how I hastened home when I had
seen her depart&mdash;how, with just one look at their
old garden, which ran back of my father's house,
through whose paths we had wandered so often
together&mdash;how with one thought of how lonely I was
and always should be, now that <i>she</i> was gone, I
hied away to my room, that I might be alone with
my sorrow. But every thing seemed determined to
speak out to me of <i>her</i>; there, by the window, was
<i>her</i> "old arm-chair;" she had given it to me as a
keepsake; and many, many a time had the broad,
leather-covered seat supported us both&mdash;so, of course,
the very sight of that gave me such a blue-fit that I
threw myself into its open "arms," and indulged in
the most luxurious fit of weeping, the length whereof
might be counted by hours, not by minutes. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
when I had fairly "cried it out," (you know all
things must have an end,) I went to bed with the
most dreadful headache conceivable, and opened
with more of regret than curiosity, the last "testament"
of dear Flory.</p>

<p>It was in the shape of a long, long letter, filling
many pages of paper; but I shall not indulge you,
reader, with a glance even, at all the contents&mdash;satisfy
yourself with these few extracts, and oblige
yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Writing is not my <i>forte</i>, Carry, you know that
very well," the epistle began, "but I had for a long
time determined to explain myself to you; and when
father finally succeeded in convincing mother that
the West is <i>such</i> a wonderful country, and that it is
the best and only place for them to safely settle <i>our</i>
troop of boys, then I made up my mind to <i>write</i> you
what I had intended to speak. Don't think me vain,
but I'm going to be my own heroine in these pages;
I'm going to give you the key wherewith to unfold
parts of my life, which you, with others, may now
think quite unexplainable.</p>

<p>"When I am gone, and the partial regret some will
feel at first, is worn away, and they begin with all
earnestness to give me what <i>they</i> think <i>my</i> 'due,'
and honor me once more with the flattering titles
they have given me before this, then do you, my
friend, take up the gauntlet in my defence. If I
should happen to die of those horrible 'fevers,'
into whose hands we are about to commit ourselves,
'Aunt Sally,' <i>may</i> say it is a just 'dispensation of
Providence' that has removed me; and that old
Juliet Baker <i>might</i> take it into her head to write my
veritable history, under the title of 'The Coquette,'
and so be published in one of the magazines as a
warning for all who shall come after me&mdash;an immortality
to which I assure you I do not aspire. Or Tom
Harding might be tempted to discourse more eloquently
than ever on my respective demerits&mdash;drawing
some of his sage conclusions therefrom. So, dear,
if such things <i>should</i> happen, remember to stand up
valiantly for 'woman's rights,' and <i>me</i>! As I have
mentioned Tom Harding's name, I may as well, in
these 'confessions,' have done with him as speedily
as possible. I know very well what all the gossips
said when it was rumored that I had 'cut him dead,'
after encouraging the poor fellow, who was really
'too good for me!' But, as it happened in <i>this</i> case,
they were all wrong&mdash;as doth unfortunately sometimes
happen even with gossipers. Tom, since time immemorial,
(you will bear me out in the truth of this statement,)
has been one of the most <i>active beaux</i> in our
village; attaching himself, with all his <i>canine</i> characteristics,
to every lady who was favored with the least
pretensions to beauty, and making himself vastly useful
in the way of getting up all sorts of 'parties of pleasure'
in summer, and in the winter also. It was very
needful, was it not, that we should be always on
good terms with <i>him</i>, which, as a body, we managed
very well to do. As he had been <i>in love with</i>,
and offered himself to at least a dozen girls of our
acquaintance, I don't yet know why he should have
thought that <i>I</i> would take up with him at last. Now
was it not presumption, Carry? To be sure, he came
to our house night after night, and sat often with us
in church on Sundays&mdash;and it <i>was</i> rumored we were
engaged; but that, I fancy, did not make the case a
clear one."</p>

<p><i>Ladies</i> may be attentive and agreeable, even over
the verge of intimacy with one another, and yet not
be suspected of <i>designs matrimonial</i>; but boys and
girls, who have from early childhood grown up with
the most fraternal feelings, as soon as childhood has
passed, must be expected to give up what was a very
delightful kind of friendship, indeed; is that wise?</p>

<p>"The fact is, I never for a moment thought of
marrying Tom Harding; but I <i>did</i> think him a great
deal better youth than he proved to be. When he
foolishly proposed <i>the</i> subject to me, I dismissed it
again quietly as might be, convincing him, as I hope,
that the thing was forever impossible. And I kept
his secret well. No one till to-day can say that I
was ever guilty of parading this offer, and its refusal,
before my friends; and I scarcely think <i>you</i> will
consider me as parading it <i>now</i>; or, indeed, of
entering on this recital merely to gratify a foolish
personal vanity. Tom, himself, by his ungentlemanly
conduct, exposed all that ever was exposed; and his
impudent, silly behavior toward me has had the
final result of making me heartily despise him; and I
sincerely hope no damsel that <i>I</i> love will ever accept
offers, which some dozens may yet have the honor,
or&mdash;which is it? be <i>doomed</i> to hear!</p>

<p>"Harry Kirkland was, indeed, a fine fellow&mdash;at
least I thought so once, for I was engaged to him
within a time I well remember. Talented, too&mdash;was
he not? But, oh, what an unreasonable mortal he
was.</p>

<p>"When I engaged myself to Harry, I did love him
truly, or what I <i>thought</i> was him, but you will not
wonder that my love cooled before such evidences
of tyranny, <i>incipient</i> it could hardly be called, as he
exhibited, truly in a petty manner, but giving me
good, overpowering evidence of what I might expect
when the <i>chains</i> of Hymen should be flung
around us.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> went to his Club, and the Lyceum, and became
a member of the Odd Fellows Society, so soon as
there was one organized in the village&mdash;indeed, on
all points acted his own pleasure, even as to the
number of cigars he would smoke per day. And I,
like a reasonable woman, thinking all this part and
parcel of his own business, never for a moment
<i>thought</i> of interfering. But no sooner had I, in a
kind of dumb way, (foolishly enough, I confess <i>now</i>,)
answered his pathetic appeals, by acknowledging
that I loved him, than he at once, without questioning
his right and title, proceeded to take the reins of
government into his own hands. And then it was
incessantly, 'Florence, why do you allow that cox-comb
to visit you?' or, 'why did you go to the party
last night when I was away?' or, 'how <i>can</i> you
endure that conceited fool?' or, 'do, dear, arrange
your hair in some other style&mdash;curls are so common!'
or, at another time, when I had adorned myself with
special thoughts of him, and his particular taste, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
ungracious salutation would be, 'It is <i>so</i> strange you
will wear flounces&mdash;<i>I</i> cannot endure them, and they
are so unbecoming for you!'</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>did</i> give James Thompson, 'the cox-comb,'
as Harry called him, leave to understand I
was not 'at home' to him; and I stayed away from
all places of amusement to which Harry <i>would not</i>,
or could not go, (which former I came at last to
know was most frequently the case.) And I did treat
Charles Wood more coolly than my conscience approved,
for nature gave to him a good, kind heart,
if she did not make him a genius. And I left off
flounces, which my tasty little 'dress-maker' thought
'<i>such</i> a pity;' and I braided my hair, which all the
time cried out against the stiff bands I put on the
curly locks; in short, for six months I made a fool
of myself, by giving way to all my exacting lover's
whims. It makes me shudder when I think of what
had been my fate had I married him&mdash;I should have
died a very martyr long before this day.</p>

<p>"I knew that on most subjects Harry's opinion
was worth having&mdash;his judgment sound; so I resolved
to try what might be done on <i>this</i> point, which certainly
concerned our happiness so much. By degrees
I went back to my old habits, saying never a word
to him of the test I was intending to put to him.
Perhaps <i>you</i> would have proceeded differently&mdash;you
might have reasoned with him, and urged him
not to distress himself about affairs far too trifling
for him to interfere with&mdash;about which no woman
likes the interference, even of a favored lover.</p>

<p>"But such a course was not the one for me&mdash;and
in the end, a person pursuing a far different method
of reasoning might, probably would, have arrived
at the same climax that I did. Wherever among
my old friends I chose to go, I went without consulting
the pleasure of his highness, who had led me
about as a child in leading-strings quite long enough.
What books I liked, I read; concerning my judgment
on this point, perhaps, (not altogether unwarrantably
either,) quite as good as his own. I dressed
in what fashion I pleased&mdash;and wore my hair in the
style nature intended. At one determined stroke
I broke the thread-like chains which, from their
very fineness, had been more galling to me than
links of iron. I could read by Harry's look of
astonishment what his thoughts were, as he saw
these changes in me&mdash;and it was with some anxiety,
I do confess, that I awaited the result; for all this
time I loved him well, though my attachment was
<i>not</i> so selfish in its nature as was his love toward me.</p>

<p>"One day I sent Harry a note, with a purse which
I had knitted for him, and requested that he would
accompany me in the evening, when there was to
be a horseback-party on the lake-shore. In about
half an hour much was I astonished by the return of
the messenger, with an answer to my note, and my
<i>rejected gift</i>. He declined the ride also, saying that
he had a severe headache&mdash;(well might his head
ache when it contained a brain capable of suggesting
<i>such</i> a note.) After some few preliminaries, Harry
proceeded to tell me that my gifts were altogether
unacceptable so long as my heart continued not right
toward him; that I had grieved him beyond all power
of expression by the heartlessness I had exhibited
<i>in my disregard of all his wishes and opinions</i>;
this strange note ended by begging that I would not
join the riding-party that night; that he would visit
me in the evening, and receive from me then any
explanations I might be ready to make.</p>

<p>"In ten minutes more the messenger was on his
way back to Harry Kirkland's office, with a neat
package, which contained the young man's notes,
miniature, gifts, &amp;c., with an assurance, which I
wrote with a most steady hand, that my evening ride
would, doubtless, prove more agreeable than a <i>t&ecirc;te-t&ecirc;te</i>
with him, and that, as I had no explanations or
apologies to offer, he need not be under the inconvenience
of seeking me again at home, or elsewhere.
I will not speak of the manner in which I passed
that afternoon, after I had returned Harry's <i>second</i>
note, <i>un</i>answered, and <i>un</i>opened; nor what thoughts
were busy in my mind, nor what feelings were busy
in my heart. But I will tell you this, at tea-time,
when father came home, <i>he</i> did not reject his
daughter's kiss, or the purse either; and now it is
snugly resting in the bottom of his pocket, well-filled,
as I hope it ever will be.</p>

<p>"That moonlight ride&mdash;you remember it; perhaps
you remember, also, that there was no gayer mortal
among you than a certain Florence Cleveland. She
might not have slept <i>quite</i> soundly that night, when
she was alone in her little chamber, but it was not
<i>very</i> long that Harry Kirkland's image disturbed her
dreams. Harry was proud as I; doubtless he thought
himself the abused one, (and <i>that</i>, you know, is
wonderfully efficacious in curing heart-wounds,) and
I can readily believe that many times since he has
blessed the day that saved him from <i>coquetting</i>
Florence Cleveland. But&mdash;you know already how
suddenly Harry moved to New York that autumn,
and also how you wondered we did not correspond.</p>

<p>"And what of George Stephenson? Ha! ha! I
always laugh when I think of him&mdash;<i>do you</i>, dear?
What did <i>we</i> think of him, <i>mon ami</i>, till we discovered
one day, much to our amaze, that he was
engaged to us both.</p>

<p>"Never shall I forget that tableau we presented&mdash;being
our own spectators&mdash;when, with your head
resting on my knee in the old summer-house, you,
with trembling lips, told me of that delightful youth!
and of your future prospects; and how, when you
approached the interesting climax, I joined in with
you and told <i>my</i> story, too; and how, instead of our
becoming sworn foes from that hour, two more
loving and light-hearted beings seldom took pen in
hand, than we, when we wrote that joint letter, and
saved George from the fate of bigamists! Well,
there was <i>never</i> a more captivating youth than he&mdash;at
least we must <i>say</i> so, to save ourselves from the
obloquy of falling in love with such a <i>scamp</i>!
Who'd have thought it? those very stories of his
early life, and sorrows which drew such earnest tears
from <i>my</i> eyes. I suppose you, too, have wept upon
his shoulder as he told them. Ah, me!</p>

<p>"Then there was the poet, Earnest Ward. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
tolerated <i>him</i> because his father was a college friend
of my paternal, who wished us always to show him
kindness, and make the orphan feel himself not quite
so friendless. But you cannot believe that <i>I</i> loved
<i>him</i>. Poor fellow! he is dead now. He never
seemed destined to a long life to me; the fact is, he
did not possess <i>energy</i> enough to keep him alive.
And he was eternally railing against Fate and his
poverty, which no man who wishes to gain favor in
<i>my</i> eyes must indulge in. His talents <i>were not</i> of
that order which commands the ear of the public&mdash;and
yet he seemed to think so, and in that thought
centered all his hope. There was nothing practical
about Ernest. He belonged to that miserable class
of beings, (how many of them we see about us,) who
are aptly described as having lost <i>their way</i> in the
great roads of life, having early groped blindly past
the stations they were designed to fill. Ernest had a
good deal of fancy and ingenuity&mdash;more than should
have been lavished on newspaper enigmas, and
verses descriptive of the color of my hair and eyes;
he might have made a capital manufacturer, or
designer of toys. He was made, I am convinced,
for some such purpose, and might have excelled in
some such <i>art</i>; but least of all, you will acknowledge,
was Ernest Ward fitted to be <i>my</i> husband. And well
for us was it, that if he did not know it, <i>I did</i>.</p>

<p>"And, last of all of whom I will speak, there was
Edward Graham; and thus I fancy I hear him described
by some (whom I <i>will</i> say I am not sorry to
have left behind me,) 'a fine fellow! but driven to
desperation and to sea by that worthless flirt, Florence
Cleveland!' Now I will give you an opportunity,
<i>ma chere</i>, to laugh in your sleeve, if you will, for
beyond the shadow of a doubt, I am engaged to this
same Edward Graham, who departed in such desperation;
and what's more, I mean to marry him, too.</p>

<p>"And how shall I explain conduct that will appear
so strange as this to you? You know Ned Graham
<i>almost</i> as well as I do; and as we both have known
him from childhood, it would be idle in me to speak
of his fine, noble, generous character, and of his
<i>sensibleness</i>, by far a rarer component of the human
character than many people seem to imagine. Our
engagement was, I confess, an altogether unanticipated
thing to me, though there was always
a lingering thought in my mind that Ned approached
a <i>little</i> nearer my standard of manly perfection than
any suitor I ever had. You and I have often together
admired the outward man, so I will not now speak
of those great black eyes of his, which seem to pierce
you through and through, as though they <i>would</i> know
your secret thoughts, (which, as far as they regarded
him, <i>could</i> be only thoughts of admiration and respect.)
And that manly form, so sweet and noble,
that was never yet bent by the weight of a mean or
sordid thought&mdash;that <i>could not</i> stoop to any thing
low or ignoble. Now, when I tell you that Ned
has hired himself to a sea-captain, whom his father
has known from boyhood, for three years, that his
wages (excepting only a moiety) have been paid at
Ned's request into his father's hands to aid the old
man, who is now in difficulties, when I tell you this,
you will concur with me in thinking <i>my</i> Edward
Graham the most noble and generous youth in the
world.</p>

<p>"Only a week before his departure <i>we</i> made our
arrangements; for before that time Ned had never
spoken to me of love&mdash;and I never heard of his
broaching the subject to any one else, did you? In
three years he is coming back again. By that time
<i>we</i> shall have become settled, and have learned to
love our new home. What farmers we shall be!
Then Ned will join us in Wisconsin&mdash;and who says
we shall not be a happy family there? And that
Flory Cleveland will not prove herself quite tractable
and human, although people have dared and
presumed to call her a 'desperate flirt?'</p>

<p>"So, my dearest, I have given you a true history
of my <i>coquetting</i> (?) life, with the exception of those
tragedies you are acquainted with already. Frank
Blake died, it is true, but never for a moment have I
reproached myself with <i>his</i> death. He was 'found
drowned,' so the verdict of the coroner's jury ran;
but have none others been ever 'found drowned,'
than men who were in love? I am not jesting, or
speaking lightly now. Heaven knows the subject is
far too fearful to jest about! Could they who have
seemed to delight in calling me little better than a
murderess, but know what bitter, bitter hours I have
passed writhing under their 'scorpion tongues,' they
would, I think, be satisfied. I tell you again, my friend,
Frank never treated me more kindly, or considerately,
or <i>justly</i> than he did that day when I told him I <i>could
not</i> love him as he deserved to be loved, though I
must ever bear toward him the utmost respect and
the kindliest feelings. And when Tom Harding made
that incident a theme for newspaper gossip, I wonder
Heaven had not blasted the right hand that dared to
write such things!</p>

<p>"You know how afterward I went to Frank's
home&mdash;to his widowed mother. She, too, turned in
horror from me when I told her who I was, and why
I had come so far from my home in search of her.
Go to her <i>now</i>, my friend, and she will tell you that
she attaches to me <i>no</i> blame. Even the agonized,
heart-broken mother believed me, when I told her
all that had transpired between her son and me. She
<i>knows</i>, as <i>you</i> know, and as <i>I</i> know, that I never
won the affections of her son intentionally, for the
purpose of adding one more name to my list of conquests.</p>

<p>"And of that other, whose name I will not write&mdash;he
who died in the convict's cell&mdash;my friend, <i>had
I</i> aught to do with that man's crimes? The brutish
madness with which he heard my refusal of his suit&mdash;his
dreadful downward course afterward; oh, can
unreturned <i>love</i> be the instigator of such crimes?
Had he not been a reckless youth ever; disliked of
all the village boys, whose friendship, even his
wealth and good family could not buy for him? If
I would not wed a villain such as he, where rests
the blame? Oh, surely <i>not with me</i>! <i>I</i> did not
make that festering, sinful heart of his, nor did I
lure him on to hope that I would <i>ever</i> wed him. If
love is <i>heaven</i>, what were life with him!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot write more&mdash;<i>non sum qualis eram</i>!
yet the sun shines brightly on me still as in my childhood,
and the future is <i>full</i> of hope. If I have cleared
myself of the imputation of the folly and heartlessness
some have laid to my charge, it is well; <i>I</i> cannot
think that my proceedings have been <i>very</i> dreadful,
or sinful; they did not frighten honest-hearted, noble
Ned Graham.</p>

<p>"And after this, when you see a woman whose
conduct to you is quite unexplainable, and full of
mystery, listen, dear friend, and bid those around
you listen a little more earnestly, to the voice of
<i>human love and Christian charity</i>; and trust <i>me</i>,
the number of women <i>who have the power</i> to act
<i>long</i> in direct opposition to all the better impulses of
woman's nature, is <i>surprisingly small</i>.</p>

<p>"If your trust continues in me still unshaken, as in
the days gone by, come ere long to Wisconsin, and
I will insure you a husband of the 'free soil,' who
shall bear as little resemblance to <i>our</i> faithless
George, as my Ned does&mdash;and a home in the wilderness,
this glorious wilderness.</p>

<p>"God bless you, love&mdash;good bye!&mdash;--."</p>

<p>"I have not yet obeyed the call of my friend to the
far west," <i>now</i> her happy home. Do you think it
advisable that I should place myself in the hands of
such a&mdash;; but first let me ask you,</p>

<p><i>Do</i> you think Florence Cleveland was a coquette?</p>

<p>And&mdash;<i>is</i> this <i>once</i> prolific topic <i>yet</i> exhausted?</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this discourse, "my hearers,"
without repeating to you a song, which appeared
some years ago in "Graham." It is by Miss Barrett.
Has it ever yet been "set to music?" if not, I would
advise some composer to neglect no longer so beautiful
an effusion. And when the <i>deed is done</i>, let
every lady learn the song, and every gentleman
stand by and listen to it humbly. Here it is.</p>

<h5>[SEE ENGRAVING.]</h5>


<p>"A man overboard!"</p>

<p>I heard the cry distinctly as the dark waters whirled
me astern.</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Heave over a coop!"</p>

<p>"Can you see him?"</p>

<p>"Clear away the quarter-boat!"</p>

<p>These were the cries that followed each other in
rapid succession, accompanied with the hurried tread
of feet, which rose even over the sounds of the
whistling hurricane and of the roaring water in
which I was immersed.</p>

<p>We had been out from Marseilles about three
days, and were now well up with the Straits. A
gale which had begun just after dawn had increased
with such violence that before the afternoon set in
we were lying-to under a storm stay-sail. Noticing
that the heel of the boom was chafing loose, I had
gone aloft to repair it, when a sudden lurch tore the
spar from its fastenings, and flung me into the air
like a ball shot from a twenty-four.</p>

<p>At first I sunk plumb, as if tied to a shot; but in a
few seconds began to ascend. When I reached the
surface, however, it was to find myself whirling
from the vessel's side, with a confused noise of the
howling tempest and the bubbling waters in my ears:
yet over all rose the shouts of my messmates.</p>

<p>I was so blinded by the water that I could not immediately
see. I spun around and around as in a
whirlpool, for I had been caught in the eddies under
the stern. I looked to windward, too, for the ship;
forgetting that a heavy vessel would make more
leeway than my light person. Just as I sunk in the
trough of the sea, however, I caught sight of the tall
spars pitching a short distance to leeward; and when
I rose on the next wave I took care to have my eyes
fixed in that direction. I could now behold the men
in the rigging on the look-out, and hear again distinctly
their eager and excited cries. They were all
gazing to leeward, and consequently could not see
me.</p>

<p>"Whereaway is he?"</p>

<p>"I can't see him&mdash;can you?"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;he has just sunk in the trough&mdash;no! it
was not he."</p>

<p>"Hillo!"</p>

<p>"Hil-hil-loa!"</p>

<p>While these cries were following each other, the
skipper himself came on deck, and springing on the
tafferel cast a rapid glance around the horizon. I
thought his eye had lighted on me, for, unlike the
rest, he turned to windward; but, after a hasty glance
in the right direction, he, too, looked off to leeward.
How my heart sunk within me! Was I to perish,
and within hearing too, in consequence of this mistake
of my messmates? I raised my voice and
shouted. I could still hear the answers.</p>

<p>"Ahoy!&mdash;aho-o-y!"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that was his voice certainly&mdash;can't you
see him yet?"</p>

<p>"Ahoy!&mdash;ahoy!&mdash;aho-o-y!" I repeated, straining
my lungs to the utmost.</p>

<p>"Hillo!" replied the stentorian voice of the skipper,
the words struggling faintly against the wind.</p>

<p>The ship was rapidly drifting down to leeward,
and I knew that if not soon discovered I was lost, so
I shouted again.</p>

<p>"Aho-o-y!&mdash;A-hoy!&mdash;A-hoy!&mdash;Aho-o-y!"</p>

<p>The last word was frantically prolonged, and I
watched its effect for a full minute with intense
anxiety. It was evident from the manner in which
my comrades on board glanced anew around the
horizon, as also from the shouts which they uttered
in reply, that my cry had reached them. I could not
indeed hear their hail, but saw their hands to their
mouths as when persons shout loudly. Alas! the
same fatal error of still looking in the wrong direction
prevailed among them: not an eye was turned
to windward. My heart died within me.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" I cried, "they do not hear me, and I
am lost. My mother&mdash;my poor, poor mother."</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that, on my falling overboard,
the cook, who had been cleaning knives in the galley,
had mechanically flung the board he was using into
the sea. Luckily it floated near me, and catching it,
I placed it, end up, under my chin, and thus supported
my head above the water without difficulty.
But for this, perhaps, I should have been wearied out
already by the surges which would have broke over
me continually, but which I now generally rode. I
also had on my oilskin cap and coat: an equally fortunate
circumstance.</p>

<p>After giving way, therefore, for a few minutes to
despondency, as I saw the ship drifting off, I rallied
myself, and, reflecting that hope never dies while
there is life, began to consider my situation more
calmly. The comparative buoyancy of my dress,
added to the board I had so fortunately obtained,
would enable me to keep afloat for an hour, or perhaps
for even a longer period, and in that time what
chances might not turn up! I knew the Gulf was
crowded with vessels. I had observed a French
frigate, lying-to, to windward, just before I fell overboard.
The direction in which I was drifting would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
carry me near her, when I might be more fortunate
in attracting attention. I cheered my heart with this
reflection, and began to look out for the man-of-war.</p>

<p>My first object, in this new frame of mind, was to
get rid of my boots, which were by this time full of
water, and began sensibly to drag me down. With
great difficulty I succeeded in pulling them off; for I
had to retain hold of my board with one hand while
I worked at the boot with the other. At last I was
rid of those dangerous encumbrances, and, floating
more lightly, had a better opportunity to look around.
Of course my vision of distant objects was cut off
every moment by my being carried down into the
trough of the sea. No one, who has not been in a
similar situation, can appreciate the awfulness with
which I gazed on the dark, glistening sides of the
immense billows, as I saw myself sinking away
from them, as if to the very bottom of the ocean.
With what horrid mockery the glassy waters seemed
to rise mountain high all around me. Suddenly,
when I was at the lowest, I would begin to ascend,
as if by magic, from that gloomy gulf, my velocity
increasing every instant, until at last I would shoot
upward above the crest of the wave, like an arrow
propelled from the abyss. A toss of the head, to
shake off the water, a long drawn breath, to recover
myself, a hasty glance around, and then I was whirled
downward again, half smothered in the wild abyss.</p>

<p>I had been overboard half an hour before I caught
sight of the French frigate. When at last I beheld
her, I could scarcely restrain a cry of joy. She was
drifting rapidly toward me, and would pass within
hail. How beautiful she looked! Her symmetrical
hull, that floated buoyantly as some wild-fowl: her
tall spars, unrelieved by a single bit of canvas, except
the close-reefed maintop-sail under which she
was lying-to: these, penciled against the horizon,
formed together a picture of grace and beauty unsurpassed.
Now she would pitch head-foremost into
the sea; now slowly rise dripping from the deluge.
Here and there a look-out was visible dotting her
rigging. As she swung, pendulum-like, the wild and
whirling clouds that rapidly traversed the distant sky
seemed one moment to stand still, and then to speed
past her with accelerated velocity. In the midst of
peril as I was I still felt all the charm of this picture.</p>

<p>Suddenly I reflected&mdash;what if I should miss the
frigate? There were other vessels in sight, but none
in my track, for by this time I could calculate, with
some approach to accuracy, the direction of my drift.
Again the thought of my mother came up to me. I
was her only son&mdash;her almost sole hope&mdash;the comfort
and darling of her old age. Perhaps even now
she was thinking of me. I seemed to see her silver
hair, and hear her mild voice once more. Then the
vision of that gray head bowed in grief arose. I beheld
her in the weeds of deep mourning, bent in body
and prostrated in mind. They had told her that her
child had been lost overboard months ago, and was
now a thousand fathom in the sea. I groaned audibly.
God knows, even in that awful hour, it was less of
myself than of my mother I thought!</p>

<p>I was now rapidly approaching the frigate.</p>

<p>"Hillo!&mdash;hil-lo!" I cried, waving my arm above
my head, as I rose on the crest of a wave.</p>

<p>I had but an instant to watch the effect of my cry,
before I was submerged again. But there was time
enough to assure me that I had not been heard.</p>

<p>I noticed, with terrible misgivings, that my voice
was much weaker than it had been half an hour before.
Was I so soon becoming exhausted? At this
rate, an hour more would probably extinguish life.</p>

<p>This idea filled me with alarm, and as I gained the
crest of the next billow, I made a desperate exertion
to shout both louder and quicker.</p>

<p>"Hillo!&mdash;hillo!&mdash;hillo-o-o!" I frantically cried.</p>

<p>I was still prolonging the sound when the comb of
a wave went over me, and half blinded as well as
smothered, I was tumbled headlong down into the
trough of the sea, which I reached more dead than
alive. I was still so exhausted when I rose on the
next billow that I could not speak.</p>

<p>With agony inexpressible I now saw myself nearly
abreast of the frigate. Another descent, another mad
whirl upward, and I found her shooting from me. I
was now almost delirious with despair,</p>

<p>"Hillo!&mdash;ahoy!" I cried. "Oh! for the love of
God, hear me!"</p>

<p>I fancied I saw a look-out turn toward me. I
knew he must have heard me. If I could have remained
on the top of that surge an instant longer his
eye would have fallen on me; but the insatiate gulf
demanded me, and seized in the embraces of the pitiless
waters, I was hurried downward to darkness and
death.</p>

<p>When I next rose to the light of day, the man-of-war
was fast receding. I was so utterly drenched,
so breathless from being nearly smothered, that I
could not raise my voice above that of a child, and
hence failed to attract the attention of the look-out
whom I still saw gazing in search of me. May
Heaven grant that none who read these words may
ever experience feelings similar to mine at that moment!
In another instant I had recovered my voice,
but the frigate was now out of hearing.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as I was giving way to despair, I
saw in the distance a large ship driving before the
gale, under a reefed maintop-sail and storm stay-sail.
She was heading directly toward me. This afforded
a new gleam of hope. If I could but arrest her attention,
I thought I should be rescued. I forgot that it
would be first necessary to throw her into the wind,
and that the risk of her broaching-to in this man&oelig;uvre
would probably prevent her paying any attention
to my cries.</p>

<p>On she came, racing like some mad courser, yet
riding the gigantic billows buoyantly as a bird. Now
half enveloped in the driving foam&mdash;now rolling her
vast yard-arms almost to the water&mdash;now showing
her keel as far back as the dripping fore-chains, she
presented a spectacle of the most terrible sublimity.
The scene around, too, added to the awful majesty of
the picture. Just as she rose on a colossal wave, in
the trough of which I was buried an immense distance
beneath her, a flash of lightning blazed across
her track, while, at the same instant, the clouds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
rolled away behind her, as if lifted like a curtain,
and the sun burst forth in all his glory. Never shall
I forget the sight! The after part of the gallant ship
was buried in the crest of the wave, which, beating
over her quarter, flew into the maintop itself. Her
fore part had outrun the billow, and hung for a second
suspended over the abyss. Then, like a falcon stooping
from its height, she swooped down into the gulf,
the wild waters roaring after her, like wolves in pursuit
of their prey.</p>

<p>She was somewhat to leeward of me, but nevertheless
I shouted with all my might, again and again.</p>

<p>It was in vain. Her crew clinging to the rigging,
were all engaged each in his own preservation, and
no more noticed the half-buried figure calling to them,
than they observed the sea-bird that, like an <i>avant
courier</i>, swept the billow before them. I shouted, I
shrieked, I waved my arm frantically over my head.
But all to no purpose. I heard the fierce bubbling of
the waters as the mighty ship tore through them close
at hand; I caught a glimpse of the pale and terrified
faces of her crew, gleaming out in the angry light of
the setting sun: and then the vision passed, a Titanic
wave upheaved between us, and I was alone.</p>

<p>Alone on the illimitable ocean! Alone while night
was drawing on! Alone with no chance of escape
remaining! Far, far to leeward, just visible occasionally
over the distant surges, I saw my own vessel;
but, except this, the horizon was now without a
speck.</p>

<p>I burst into tears. The tension of my nerves had
been unnatural; they now gave way: and, as I saw
nothing but death before me, I wept like a child.
Yet still it was the thought of my mother that affected
me, not any consideration of self. My whole past
life rushed in review before me. I saw myself at
my mother's knee looking and wondering as she
taught me to pray. I was a boy going to school,
now chasing a butterfly, now watching the angler
from the village bridge, but ever loitering on my way.
I saw my little sister die, and after her, one by one,
in that season of terrible epidemic, my four brothers.
I followed my father to the grave, the last victim of
that pestilence: I wept with my surviving parent: I
promised always to stay by her: I was her all in all.
And then, with the flight of years, came other pictures.
I was older and more adventurous, but, I
fear, not wiser nor better. A strange longing for the
sea had seized me. I had secretly joined a ship sailing
to the Mediterranean, and was now on my return.
But, alas! I was never to see that happy
home again. The avenging bolt of God had overtaken
me. No mother would ever weep above my
ashes, no kind hand would deck the sod with flowers.
My doom was to be tossed to and fro, midway down
the depths of ocean, until the trumpet of the arch-angel
should sound.</p>

<p>The night began to close in. Darker and darker
the shades of evening fell around the waste of waters,
and the wind, as it went by, seemed moaning my
requiem. Occasionally the lightning threw a ghastly
radiance across the water. I was cold, weary, and
half stupefied. My senses began to desert me. No
longer able to buffet against fate as I had done, I
took in each moment larger draughts of the briny
element. In fact I was drowning. Things actual
and things visionary&mdash;the present and the past&mdash;began
to commingle in my brain in a wild phantasmagoria.
Faces of childhood, the sweet faces of my
dead brothers and sisters, looked at me from the sky
above; while hideous ones, the countenances seen
in fever-dreams, grinned out from the spray around.
Confused noises, too, were in my ears. There was
music as if from celestial spheres; then notes as if
demons laughed in the gale. Gradually all things,
seen or heard, became more and more indistinct; a
dead blank swum before me, leaving only the sensation
of blackness: and then followed utter forgetfulness,
the stupor of the dead&mdash;or rather that trance between
life and death, when the body is exhausted
but the vital spark not yet fled&mdash;that one dread pause
between this world and the next.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of any thing further, until I
was partially roused from my insensibility by a hand
being laid on me. The next instant I was dragged
violently through the water, and thrown on my chest
across some sharp substance, which I concluded was
the gunwale of a boat. I fell with such force as to
eject from me, as from a force-pump, the water I had
swallowed. The excessive pain roused me to more
complete consciousness. I languidly opened my eyes.
I thought I recognized familiar faces: the doubt was
settled immediately by a well known voice.</p>

<p>"Easy there, Jack&mdash;poor fellow! he is almost
gone&mdash;now, my hearties!"</p>

<p>The words were spoken in the kind tone of the
mate. I knew now that I had been picked up by our
ship's boat. She was lying head-on to the waves,
to prevent her being swamped while she took me up.
Obeying the directions of the mate, the men with a
second effort lifted me completely out of the water,
and laid me in the stern-sheets of the boat.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" asked the mate. "God help
us, we were looking for you in the wrong direction,
till, all at once, I remembered you ought to be to
windward, and so at last made you out, a mere speck
on the horizon. We had a hard pull to reach you
too! At first I thought we should be swamped. But
here you are safe. And now, lads, give way lustily."</p>

<p>The crew, at these words, put double strength into
their oars, and away we sped toward the ship. What
a sensation of comfort and security came over me
as I felt the planks under me, and heard the waters,
which, cheated of their prey, followed roaring in our
wake.</p>

<p>I looked up toward the mate, who, steering with
one hand, was covering me with his jacket with the
other. He was doing it, too, as tenderly as a mother
wraps her babe. Oh! how full my heart was. I
tried to raise myself on my elbow and speak.</p>

<p>"Nay! shipmate," he said, placing his hand on
my shoulder gently, as if to press me down, "not a
word. You need rest: you were three hours in the
water."</p>

<p>In truth, this little exertion had made me dizzy. I
heard his words as in a dream, and sunk back, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
all things seemed to whirl around me. I closed my
eyes, and presently, in a whisper, the mate said&mdash;</p>

<p>"He sleeps. I don't think he could have stood it
five minutes longer. Who would have told his
mother?"</p>

<p>From this time until I woke in my berth, I lay in
a state of profound insensibility. They have since
told me that on reaching the ship they thought me
gone; but that by chafing my limbs, and employing
stringent restoratives they recovered me. I soon
after sunk into a refreshing sleep, and when I woke
in the morning was perfectly well, though weak.</p>

<p>It was quite dark, it appears, when we reached the
ship, so that if my discovery had come a few minutes
later, it is exceedingly doubtful whether or not I
could have been saved.</p>

<p>Years have passed since then, and I have rehearsed
my deliverance a hundred times, yet I always shudder
to recall those terrible hours when <span class="smcap">Overboard
in the Gulf</span>.</p>

<h3>OR THE KING OUTWITTED.</h3>

<hr class="short" />
<h4>BY JOSEPH A. NUNES.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p>"We shall see," gentlemen, said King Charles, as
he strode with a hasty step across the apartment,
"whether my lord of Rochester's presence is as
essential to the court and to the amusement of the
king, as his vanity induces him to suppose."</p>

<p>"The expression was a thoughtless one," observed
the young Count de Grammont, who was present,
"and doubtless not intended for your majesty's ears."</p>

<p>"Yet it was made, De Grammont," replied the
king, "and, by the soul of St. Paul! he shall be responsible
for it. Rochester presumes too much on
our clemency, which he has so often experienced,
but which he shall have no reason to slight again."</p>

<p>"Be merciful, my liege, for the sake of his wit,"
said the Duke of Buckingham, with an ill-concealed
smile at the king's petulance.</p>

<p>"Better he had none, George," replied the king,
"for he knows not how to use it. Odds-fish! he as
essential to Charles as Charles to him! We have
more wits at court, my lords, than Rochester.
There's yourself, Buckingham, and De Grammont,
there, and Killegrew, Sedly, and a dozen others who
can make a pigmy of this Goliah!"</p>

<p>"But your majesty will limit the period of his disgrace?"
asked De Grammont, who was sincerely
friendly toward the obnoxious earl.</p>

<p>"We will put this limit to it, and none other,"
replied Charles. "When Rochester's wit is seductive
enough to induce his king, personally, to wait
upon him three several times, or to command his
presence at court, then he may return, and not before;
but come, gentleman, we have other things to attend
to this morning without wasting time upon an
ingrate."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>The wittiest man at the wittiest court in Europe&mdash;that
of Charles the Second of England&mdash;was undoubtedly
John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester; and innumerable
are the anecdotes that have been related
of him in connection with his friend and sovereign,
Charles. Rochester's wit, however, sometimes resulted
in inconvenience to himself, and was occasionally
the means of having him banished from the court.
This circumstance generally occurred at least once
a year, and sometimes oftener, as in seeking amusement
for himself and friends, he held nothing sacred.
Persons and things alike shared his satire and his
wit, and even majesty was not always exempt from
the shafts he lavished so freely on all sides.</p>

<p>The dialogue detailed in the last chapter was the
result of one of those indiscretions. He had presented
Charles to the court in so very ridiculous a
light, that the monarch became highly incensed, and
banished him from his presence. Rochester, at the
time, happened to be engaged in an intrigue with one
of the maids of honor to the Duchess of York, which
made this interruption to his avocations the more
unpleasant than it otherwise would have been. He
bore it, however, with his usual humor, and left the
court, declaring that his disgrace could not be of long
duration, as he was quite as indispensable to Charles
as Charles was necessary to him, and that within two
months he would be recalled.</p>

<p>This inconsiderate boast had, as we have seen,
been as inconsiderately repeated to the king, and resulted
in the monarch's declaration that Rochester
should not return to court until his wit had induced
him, Charles, either to wait upon him three several
times, or to command his presence.</p>

<p>The Count de Grammont took an early opportunity
of communicating this resolution to his friend, and
though he was himself sanguine in his hopes, and
fertile in his invention, he was not a little surprised
at the indifferent, not to say facetious, manner of its
reception by Rochester.</p>

<p>"I accept his majesty's challenge," exclaimed the
wit, laughing; "and by Miss Hobart's wrinkles, and
the fair Temple's smiles, I swear, I am now disposed
to say that within a single moon our sacred,
sapient king shall command the presence of his most
melancholy subject; ay, and wait upon him, too."</p>

<p>"Be not too confident, <i>mon chere ami</i>" said De
Grammont, "for this time, for a wonder, our Charles
is serious, and he must work deeply and sharply
who outwits him."</p>

<p>"But he shall be outwitted, O, most unbelieving
of infidels!" cried Rochester, "if thou wilt only
prove true to me."</p>

<p>"Thou hast me as sure as thy blade," replied the
count.</p>

<p>"Then within a month," said the earl, "the smiles
of Rochester shall once more illuminate the court;
and those who sigh in sadness now shall confess that
the sun shone not during his absence. Do you but
second my projects, and obey my behests, and Charles
shall admit that he is no match for Rochester."</p>

<p>"But whither go you now to banishment?" asked
De Grammont, as Rochester rose to leave him.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me anon," replied the earl;
"I go to make an actress of my lady's maid, and to
study snares for the king."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>Rochester left London for a day or two to conceal
the traces of his whereabouts; but disguising himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
completely, and assuming the habit of a simple
citizen, he soon returned, and selected an ostensible
residence, where he intended, for the time, to appear
in the character he had adopted.</p>

<p>Chance, in this vagary, had given to Rochester, as
a host, a gentleman and a soldier, who had once been
an equal and a companion.</p>

<p>A cavalier officer, and one of the most devoted to
his king, Colonel Boynton, had fought in almost
every battle against the troops of the parliament, and
distinguished himself sufficiently in several to attract
the royal notice, and to elicit the commendation of
his king. With the loss of the royal cause, Colonel
Boynton retired, wounded both in person and in fortune,
to private life, where, in the society of his
wife and infant daughter, he strove to forget the
downfall of the unfortunate though guilty Charles,
and the ruin of his family.</p>

<p>The triumph of the parliamentary cause still further
affected Boynton's fortunes; yet, when some years
after he knew that the sons of his royal master were
fugitives in a foreign land, and in pecuniary distress,
he did not hesitate to impoverish himself in order to
minister to their necessities; trusting to Providence
and his own exertions for his immediate wants, and
to the re-establishment of the monarchy and the royal
gratitude for his future fortune.</p>

<p>Colonel Boynton had lived to see the son of the
First Charles ascend the throne; but his just expectations,
with regard to his own fortune, had not been
realized. Too proud to present himself to the royal
notice to claim the reward of his services, and the
return of his advances, when he thought that gratitude
required he should be sought out, he languished,
with his daughter, who had now grown up to be a
beautiful maiden, neglected and unnoticed in a condition
not many degrees removed from absolute
want; struggling for the means of existence, and
cherishing each hour increased feelings of bitterness
against the king and the court.</p>

<p>It was with Colonel Boynton that Rochester now
took up his abode, nor was it long before he recognized
the heroic soldier of former times; and wild,
reckless and dissipated as Rochester was, he could
not help deeply sympathizing with the condition of
Boynton, and determining to assist in having justice
done to him. But from the Colonel himself he met
with an impediment he had not expected; for when,
in his assumed character, (Rochester did not disclose
himself,) he suggested the king's ignorance of
his existence and urged him to present himself to the
monarch's notice, the old soldier unhesitatingly and
indignantly refused, alleging proudly, that it was not
for him personally to quicken the king's memory,
adding, that if his services could be so easily forgotten,
he was satisfied they should forever remain
in oblivion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this unexpected obstinacy the
earl resolved to serve the veteran and his motherless
child, and he conceived a plot at the same time, by
which he purposed making the colonel's history subservient
to his design of outwitting the Merry
Monarch.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>A fortnight had hardly elapsed since the retirement
of Rochester from court, when the reputation
of a German doctor&mdash;said to be a wonderful astrologist&mdash;began
to be generally noised about. He had
located himself, on his arrival, in an obscure corner
of the city of London, and his practice was at first
confined to valets, waiting-maids, and such like persons;
but so astounding and veracious had been his
disclosures to these, that his fame rapidly reached
the upper circles, and aroused the curiosity of the
lords and ladies of the court. No sooner had he obtained
this run of custom than he became a made
man, with every prospect of a speedy fortune before
him; for the displays of his art, with which he had
petrified his more humble patrons, carried no less
astonishment amongst the more fashionable ones,
who at first affected to disbelieve in it, and who
originally sought only to while away the tedium of
an idle hour by laughing at the grossness of his impositions.
But he had overwhelmed them with consternation
by his knowledge, and his information of
the intrigues with which they were all more or less
connected; he covered them with confusion for themselves,
at the same time that they could not withhold
their admiration of his skill. He was quickly esteemed
a wonderful man, to whom all hidden things were
open, and who could decipher the pages of the past
and future as readily as he could read the events
which were transpiring around him.</p>

<p>Now to pretend that any supernatural powers had
been displayed by the learned astrologer, Doctor
Herman Von Lieber, (for that was the name under
which this tenth wonder suffered himself to be known,)
would, perhaps, be going too far; though it was certain
that he possessed a knowledge of persons, and
of the history of individuals who sought him, that
was really startling; and if we consider that the
development of personal matters of scandal, which
we thought confined to our own breasts, is more
apt to astound us than effects which are positively
inexplicable and beyond the reach of human ken,
we will not be surprised at the celebrity which our
astrologer suddenly acquired.</p>

<p>All the court was in commotion at his disclosures,
and the royal curiosity had been excited.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon the Chevalier de Grammont
proposed to the king the idea of disguising themselves
and paying a visit to the astrologer, who had created
so great a sensation; and the monarch, who was
anxious that the time until evening&mdash;when he, with
the chevalier, had a new adventure to inspire them&mdash;should
pass rapidly away, consented readily to the
suggestion.</p>

<p>At the residence of the astrologer they found all
the arrangements of the most singular character.
They were met at the door by a couple of Ethiopeans,
fantastically dressed, who conducted them,
without question, through a suit of dim-looking
apartments to one which would have been quite
dark, had its gloom not been relieved by a few
small antique lamps, whose light barely sufficed
to disclose the necromantic arrangements of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the room and the untranslatable hieroglyphics
around.</p>

<p>After bidding them be seated, one of the blacks
approached a strange-looking table, and rang a
small silver bell, then lighting another lamp, which
in burning dispersed an aroma through the room,
he, with his companion, left our adventurers to
themselves.</p>

<p>"Odds-fish, De Grammont," exclaimed the king,
as the door closed, "the sorcerer knows enough of
human nature to commence his tricks by astonishing
the outward senses, thereby rendering the conquest
of the intellectual man the more simple."</p>

<p>"This looks necromancy, certainly;" replied De
Grammont, "but let us see further before we confess
ourselves bewitched, even by so great an adept."</p>

<p>At this moment a door at the further end of the
apartment opened, and a tall, stately, venerable
looking man entered. His dress was almost grotesque,
but there was a certain dignity about it
which redeemed it from being entirely so. It was
surmounted by a magnificent robe trimmed with
sables and decorated with a variety of unknown
orders. Upon his head he wore a richly wrought
velvet cap, from beneath which his long silvery hair
escaped and reached quite down to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Men seek me," said the astrologer, (for it was
him) "but for two purposes: either to have the past
rehearsed to them, or to lift the veil of time and unravel
the mysteries of the future. For which of
these do you come?"</p>

<p>"Most learned doctor," said Charles, smiling at
his companion, "we come for both purposes; but
more especially are we here to test that wisdom, the
reputation of which has reached the four corners of
the earth and filled the most profound with wonder."</p>

<p>"You sneer, my son," observed the doctor, gravely,
"but nevertheless your wishes shall be gratified,
for even a skeptic may be made a believer. Shall I
expound the past to you?"</p>

<p>"First enlighten my incredulous companion as to
his fate," replied Charles, "and then I will judge
how far you can speak of mine."</p>

<p>"Give me the hour of your birth," said the doctor,
turning to De Grammont, "and I will consult the
stars in reference to your fortune."</p>

<p>De Grammont did as he was desired, and the
astrologer left the apartment. In a few moments he
returned.</p>

<p>"You are not what you seem!" he said, seating
himself, and addressing De Grammont.</p>

<p>"Pray heaven you prove me no worse," replied
De Grammont, laughing; "I am a thriving merchant,
though I would fain be a lord or a duke."</p>

<p>"The merchandise you deal in," said the astrologer,
"is to be found in the mart of fashion, where
frailty, unrebuked, boldly lifts its head by the side
of innocence, making the latter undistinguishable
Thou hast naught to do with those wares that make
a nation's commerce."</p>

<p>De Grammont laughed as he asked him of his
parentage and past fortune.</p>

<p>"You are nobly derived," replied the astrologer:
"you have been the companion of kings."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" exclaimed Charles, "thy art discloses
naught. Thou wilt surely make me an emperor if
my friend is already the companion of kings."</p>

<p>After a few more questions, which were as
shrewdly answered by the adept, it became the
disguised monarch's turn to learn his fate.</p>

<p>"Yours has been a checkered life," the doctor
said, when he had, as before, consulted the stars.
"The planets show that you have been beset by as
many and as great vicissitudes even as the monarch
now seated upon England's throne, and that thou
hast profited as little by them."</p>

<p>Charles exchanged a smile with De Grammont, as
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought you had a throne reserved for me,
though I fear me 'tis in the moon it must be fixed.
Prove but your words, however, and thou shalt be
my chief favorite."</p>

<p>"That," replied the astrologer, "is too precarious
a place for me. They say that Rochester is banished
from King Charles's court, and what hope could I
have of pleasing if he could be dispensed with?
Nevertheless, I'll prove my words."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, of the present," said Charles.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you of a war, and a concluded treaty of
peace, that the world knows not yet of."</p>

<p>"With what nation, most sapient sir?" asked the
monarch, laughing.</p>

<p>"With a woman!" replied the doctor. "There
is one, who this morning was styled a countess, and,
as such, waged war against you; the preliminaries
of peace have been signed, and she is now the
Duchess of Cleveland, for which concession she has
consented to abjure the society of St. Albans'
nephew, Jermyn, and to meddle no more with his
Majesty's passion for the pretty Stewart!"</p>

<p>"Thou dealest with the devil!" exclaimed the
monarch, startled into an awkward admission.</p>

<p>"<i>I deal with the stars</i>," replied the doctor, gravely,
"<i>and they are unerring guides</i>."</p>

<p>"Let them speak of the future, then, and perchance
I may think so."</p>

<p>"There is a bird a monarch seeks to cage, though
the trembler knows him not. This night he hies to
her bower in a strange habit, and hopes to win her
thence; but let him take heed that more eyes look
not on him than the young bird's; she may escape,
and he be unmasked."</p>

<p>"Odds my life! my friend, I think thou knowest
me," cried Charles, laughing, as he drew a purse
from his belt.</p>

<p>"The stars proclaim thee England's king," replied
the astrologer, as he bent his knee to the monarch.</p>

<p>Charles satisfied himself by asking a few more
questions, then threw the doctor his purse, and, bidding
him come to the palace to receive another, he
departed.</p>

<p>The doctor reseated himself, and taking off his
cap and venerable wig he disclosed the now easily
recognized features of the Earl of Rochester.</p>

<p>Rochester indulged in a hearty fit of laughter, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
muttered to himself,&mdash;"Already you have been outwitted
once, friend Charles, thanks to De Grammont's
aid, and shall be thrice, or Rochester will
confess himself a fool, and unworthy to be recalled."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<p>When Rochester casually stopped, an hour after
the king's visit, at the humble residence of Colonel
Boynton, he was surprised to find much confusion
there. Two rough-looking strangers seemed to
have taken possession of the apartment usually
occupied by the veteran. The unfortunate old man
stood passive, cold, and immoveable, while his
pretty daughter Margaret hung round his neck,
weeping bitterly, and pleading alternately with him
and with the strangers, who&mdash;the instruments of a
flinty-hearted creditor&mdash;seemed quite unmoved by
her touching sorrow.</p>

<p>"What is this, my good friend?" asked Rochester,
taking the colonel by the hand.</p>

<p>"'Tis nothing," he replied, with a quivering lip,
as he turned his gaze upon his daughter; "I have
been deficient in punctuality to an impatient creditor,
and he thinks the discipline of a prison may
quicken my memory and resources."</p>

<p>"Out upon him, the hard-hearted knave!" exclaimed
Rochester, "he should have his ears slit to
teach him better manners."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, speak to them!" cried Margaret, pointing
to the officers; "they refuse to let me bear my
poor father company."</p>

<p>Rochester took the commitment from one of the
men, and glancing at the amount of the debt, proceeded
at once to liquidate it from the king's
purse.</p>

<p>"Hold, sir!" said Boynton, interposing. "I thank
you from my soul for your intentions, but I cannot
consent to receive charity from mortal man."</p>

<p>"I had no thought of charity, my excellent friend,"
said Rochester; "'tis only to exchange places with
your creditor that I intend, and shall, at your earliest
convenience, expect payment at your hands.&mdash;Think,"
he added in a lower tone, "of this fair girl,
and leave not her youth and inexperience exposed
to the temptations and corruptions by which she
would be surrounded in your absence."</p>

<p>This argument was too powerful to be resisted.
The gallant old colonel shook his friend's offered
hand, as he suffered him to pay the debt, and dismiss
the myrmidons of the law.</p>

<p>"I say it is no obligation," Rochester observed, in
reply to the veteran's reiterated acknowledgments;
"fortune has smiles in store for you yet, nor will
they be withheld much longer. I must leave you
now, though," he said, smiling at a passing idea,
"for I have this night to superintend the planetary
influences, in order to prevent the prognostications of
the stars from failing."</p>

<p>The colonel looked after him as he departed, but
without comprehending a word of his astrological
remarks.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<p>In a house remote from the one in which King
Charles experienced his last adventure with the pretended
astrologer, he sat again, disguised in the undress
uniform of a naval officer, with his arm
encircling the neat waist of a remarkably pretty
girl.</p>

<p>She affected to allow this liberty reluctantly, yet
there was that in her large black eyes and mischief-loving
countenance which contradicted the attempted
coyness she at first evinced.</p>

<p>"So, they call thee Margaret?" said the king, as
he leaned his face against her curls.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Stuart."</p>

<p>"And thou art poor, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Alas! yes," she replied, "my father was once a
royalist officer, and rich; but the civil wars and his
sacrifices for his king left him penniless and friendless."</p>

<p>"It has been the fate of many besides him," the
monarch observed. "Those same wars were, at
one time, the ruin of my own family. But thou,
Margaret, shalt be poor no longer. Thou shalt leave
this home of penury with me, and I will make thee
rich."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," she said, as he attempted to kiss her,
"be not so tender with your kindness. I fear already
thy sympathy and its motive."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing from me, pretty one," said Charles,
clasping her closely to him.</p>

<p>"Why are we here alone?" she asked, seeming
to realize, and be startled at the idea, for the first
time; "where is the friend who introduced you&mdash;where
is Master Granby?"</p>

<p>"He will be here anon, pretty Margaret," replied
the king, "his own affairs have called him hence for
a time. Heed him not, though, my sweet trembler,
my Peri of perfection, my Houri of Paradise! thou
art safe with me, and with me thou shalt hie away
to regions where love will smile upon thee, and
gold will pour in perpetual showers in thy lap."</p>

<p>The monarch became so inexpressibly tender that
the maiden, in her own defence, was compelled to
scream. After a moment's lapse an approaching step
upon the stairs warned the precipitate lover to defer
the prosecution of his suit to a more auspicious occasion.
He hastened to the door, but, to his astonishment,
found it fastened, and on trying the window,
that, too, had been externally cared for.</p>

<p>"De Grammont has betrayed me!" he exclaimed,
as he drew a concealed pistol from his belt and prepared
to confront the coming danger.</p>

<p>His apprehensions, were, however, groundless,
for the only person who entered the room was a tall,
athletic looking old woman, in her night dress,
wearing a remarkably heavy pair of shoes. She
placed her candle upon the table and walked deliberately
up to where the young girl was sitting.
Seeing her she started back in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Are you here, Margaret?" she exclaimed; "beshrew
me, I thought thee asleep two good hours ago,
instead of throwing thy company away upon a young
man, and a stranger. Away with you, mistress, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
your bed! You are unworthy to be called your
father's daughter."</p>

<p>"Nay, good dame, be not so hard with pretty Margaret,"
said Charles, as he saw the young girl leaving
the room with her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Out upon thee, sirrah, for a knave!" retorted the
old woman; "I'll see directly who thou art, sir
jack-a-napes. To thy chamber, Miss, and thank
Heaven for thy father's misfortune, which prevented
his being here this night."</p>

<p>When the girl had gone, she took up the light, and
approaching the king, scrutinized him closely from
head to foot.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," he said, as he suffered her to proceed
with the examination, "find you aught here to
fear?"</p>

<p>She was gazing at the moment at his face, and she
started back as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Much, much to fear!" she replied, "for I see
here the features of a king! When we find the wolf
in the sheepfold we may slay him, but who dare approach
the 'lion!'</p>

<p>The king was filled with amazement at being recognised;
but without suffering his surprise to be
evident, he endeavored to ridicule the assertion.</p>

<p>"True, dame," he remarked, "they call me the
king of good fellows; but as for a lion, the comparison
is somewhat strained; it would be more apt
with a longer-eared animal, for suffering myself to
be trapped thus sillily."</p>

<p>The old woman seized his hand, and after pointing
to the royal signet, dropped it.</p>

<p>"Charles Stuart, King of England, thou canst not
deceive me!"</p>

<p>"Faith," said the king, laughing, "methinks this
is another astrologer in petticoats!"</p>

<p>"And is it to his king," exclaimed the old woman,
reproachfully, "that the unfortunate Colonel Boynton
is indebted for a base attempt upon his daughter's
honor, at the very moment when he himself is the
tenant of a prison for having, by his loyalty, impoverished
himself! Is this the reward for the blood
he has shed, and the honorable wounds he has received
in fighting your battles, and for hastening to offer you
his last penny in a foreign land, even when his own
family was persecuted and destitute at home!"</p>

<p>"Colonel Boynton!" cried Charles, as the old
woman concluded; "surely not the brave Boynton
who served so nobly at Edge Hill, Naseby, and Worcester,
and who came to relieve his royal master's
wants when he was a wanderer and an outcast
among strangers? This cannot be his child, nor can
he be living. They told me years since, when I
caused inquiry to be made for him, that he was
dead."</p>

<p>"He knew not that his king had ever sought for
him," the old woman said; "he thought his services
and his sacrifices in the past had been willfully forgotten,
and his proud spirit scorned to thrust unpleasant
recollections upon you."</p>

<p>"Poor Boynton! poor Boynton!" exclaimed
Charles, "this has, indeed, been ingratitude to one
of the most deserving and faithful of my subjects.
Said you, my good woman, that he is now in a prison,
and for debt?"</p>

<p>"Ay, my good lord."</p>

<p>"There, there!" said Charles, hastily handing her
a weighty purse, "see that he is relieved at once&mdash;this
night, if it be possible&mdash;and bid him in the morning
wait upon his king, whose greatest regret is that
he has not met with him sooner."</p>

<p>"Will your majesty <i>write</i> your request for him
to come to the palace? he may be somewhat skeptical
of your royal solicitude."</p>

<p>"Assuredly," replied the king, as he took up a pen
from the table and drew a sheet of paper toward
him; "and do you also bear him company."</p>

<p>"Add, then, if your majesty pleases, that you desire
the <i>bearer</i> also to appear."</p>

<p>The king looked at her an instant, then did as she
suggested.</p>

<p>"And now, dame," said he, "relieve me from my
durance, and allow me to depart."</p>

<p>She hastily unfastened the door, and the king
passed out. "Be sure," said he, as he lingered a
moment at the threshold, "that you bring my pretty
Margaret with you; her fortunes, too, must be advanced
at court."</p>

<p>The old woman, after carefully fastening the door,
threw herself into a chair, and gave vent to a hearty
burst of laughter.</p>

<p>"There, Nancy, you can come down," exclaimed
the familiar voice of Rochester, as the figure of the
quondam Margaret appeared again upon the stairs.
"Thou art a good girl, and I will make thee a
capital actress yet. Old Rowley has again been
outwitted!"</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<p>The next morning three strangers&mdash;two old men
and a young girl&mdash;were admitted to the palace of
Whitehall, on showing the king's order to that effect,
but only one of the men was immediately conducted
to the king's presence.</p>

<p>The Count de Grammont, (who had made his peace
for his seeming desertion of the previous evening,)
Lord Arlington, and Sir Charles Sedly, were with
the king when Colonel Boynton was announced.</p>

<p>The old man knelt at the monarch's feet, and
taking his hand, kissed it fervently.</p>

<p>"Rise, my gallant old friend, rise!" said Charles,
assisting him as he spoke; "it gives us joy to see
one so faithful, and so long neglected, once more
near our person. Our greatest grief is that so tried
a servant, and so brave an officer as Colonel Boynton
should have been in adversity and we not know even
of his existence; but you shall be cared for, my old
friend, and the future shall prove to you that Charles
knows how to be grateful to those who have served
him when he most needed services."</p>

<p>"Your majesty is over bountiful to one who
wronged you by supposing you capable of injustice.
For this I crave your royal pardon, and also for
another and more heinous offence."</p>

<p>"Thou hast it," replied the king, "even if the
offence be treason against ourself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the offence of having imposed upon my
sovereign," exclaimed a voice that made the king
start, while Rochester, ridding himself of his disguise,
knelt before him.</p>

<p>"By my life, it is Rochester!" cried the king,
starting back from the prostrate earl, while every
one present, except De Grammont, was filled with
amazement at the sudden transformation of Colonel
Boynton.</p>

<p>Charles was at first disposed to laugh, but recollecting
his outraged dignity, he restrained himself,
and addressed his banished courtier in terms of considerable
severity.</p>

<p>"This presumption, my Lord Rochester," said he,
"ill becomes you; nor can the insult to your king
be easily atoned for."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my liege&mdash;" Rochester commenced.</p>

<p>"By what authority," said the king, interrupting
him, "have you ventured to intrude yourself upon
our presence, contrary to our express commands?"</p>

<p>"Simply by this, my gracious liege," replied the
earl, handing the paper he had received the previous
evening, and pointing to the word <i>bearer</i>.</p>

<p>"That, sir, was given to another, and a worthier
person than the Earl of Rochester."</p>

<p>"I might, your majesty," said Rochester, lowering
his voice, and approaching nearer to the king, "defend
myself from the insinuation, but I am prevented
by a powerful reason, for, when we find the
wolf in the sheepfold, we may slay him, but who
dare approach the lion."</p>

<p>Charles was astonished at hearing the old woman's
words repeated, but the fear of his own exposure
somewhat mollified his anger.</p>

<p>"So, then, thou wert thyself in masquerade?" he
said; "and with whom hast thou dealt to put this
cheat upon me."</p>

<p>"I deal with the stars," replied the earl, assuming
as nearly as possible the tone of the astrologer, "and
they are unerring guides."</p>

<p>"Odd-fish, my lord," exclaimed Charles, now
laughing heartily, "and were you the necromancer,
too?"</p>

<p>"And Colonel Boynton, too, my liege; and all for
the purpose of inducing your majesty to keep your
royal word, which said, 'When Rochester's wit is
seductive enough to induce his king, personally, to
wait upon him three several times, or to command
his presence at court, then he may return.'"</p>

<p>"I think, my lords, I have been fairly caught,"
said the king, smiling, and speaking to those around
him, "and to keep my word inviolate, must permit
Rochester's return."</p>

<p>"To prove that I am not ungrateful for your
majesty's goodness," observed the earl, "I am prepared
to produce the objects of your solicitude&mdash;Colonel
Boynton and his fair daughter&mdash;they wait
your royal pleasure."</p>

<p>On the introduction of the venerable colonel and
the pretty Margaret, the king whispered to Rochester,
"Surely, my lord, this is not the girl I saw last
night?"</p>

<p>"No, your majesty," replied the earl, "she was
a pupil of my own."</p>

<p>Charles, in a few words, satisfied Colonel Boynton
that the neglect of his faithful services had been
owing entirely to misapprehension. He gave him at
once a position which secured him against future
reverses; nor was it long before his interesting
daughter found a husband worthy of her choice.</p>

<p>Rochester's Protean exploits afforded amusement to
the court for some time. Charles bore the raillery he
heard around him philosophically, and good humoredly
admitted that he had been completely outwitted.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A child of seven summers reclined upon a couch.
Suffering and disease had so enfeebled his naturally
fragile frame, that his thin hand could scarcely sustain
a bunch of roses, which his young sister Lillias
had culled for him, from his own rose-tree; the tree
that it had been his joy and pride to attend to, when
in health. He hard marked, delighted, the first green
leaf that in the spring-time burst from its wintry repose,
and very joyously he clapped his little hands
when a streak of crimson peered out from the first
bud. He dreamed not, amid his happiness, that the
Angel of Death should steal around him before its
bright hue faded, nor that others should bud and blossom&mdash;to
wither upon his grave. Even thus it was.</p>

<p>Willie M&mdash;&mdash; was a child of unusual feeling and
sensibility, his young face often shadowing forth
strange, sad feelings&mdash;feelings that seldom exist, save
in the heart of maturer years. I have seen him gaze
upward to the bright blue sky with delight, as though
his childish ken could pierce the clouds, and commune
with the intelligences of Heaven; and a flower&mdash;a
murmuring rill&mdash;a boundless flow of water&mdash;silvery
stars&mdash;and gentle winds&mdash;failed not to arouse
enthusiastic emotions in his young heart, at which
many marveled. "None knew him but to love him,"
and in his walks with "dear papa, sweet mamma,
and darling Lillias," many an eye followed him with
blessings. "Ah," said an aged one, whom he had
cheered with sunny smiles and artless conversation,
"few will be the years of Willie M&mdash;&mdash;; he is one
of God's angels lent to earth!" and her tears fell at
the prophetic thought that even she would live to
see his winsome wee face hid beneath the coffin's lid.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A group of young children stood around his bed,
gazing with fearful wonder on the change that had
been wrought in their loved playmate. He had begged
of his mamma to send for them, that he might
see them once more; and his large, spiritual eye had
looked its welcome on each of that little band. Once
he had hunted with them the early violet in the glade
and dingle; once the echoes of his voice rang merrily
out as they bounded over the greensward in
chase of the bright, illusive butterfly&mdash;and his heart
grew sad as he felt that he should be with them no
more. A little hand was laid caressingly upon his
head&mdash;it was Gary Lincoln, and as he turned around
to look upon her he saw that her eyes were full of
tears. "Why do you cry, Gary?" said he. "Because
mamma says that you are going away to
Heaven," she replied, "and I cannot bear to think of
it&mdash;don't go, Willie, don't go!" and the tears
streamed down her young face like rain. It was her
first sorrow.</p>

<p>Willie spoke not, but a grieved, yet tender expression
rested on his countenance, and his mamma,
taking a hand of each within her own, told her that
if she were good, if they all were good children, they
should go to Willie&mdash;although he might not stay with
them. She told them of the glorious home to which
he was hastening&mdash;how happy he would be&mdash;never
to suffer more&mdash;of the white robe&mdash;the starry crown
and the tiny golden harp that should be his&mdash;and how
he would be their guardian angel, through day and
hush of night, and how joyfully he would welcome
each one to his happy home.</p>

<p>That mother's heart was bursting, and yet her absorbing
love for her child nerved her to this, and as
she told of that clime where "the soul wears its
mantle of glory," the little sufferer's eye grew so
intensely bright that it seemed unearthly. Visions
of Heaven seemed opened to his view, and with a
face radiant with delight he clasped his hands, and
said, "Dear mamma, let me go now." "We must
wait, my child, till God sends his angels for you."
"Yes," he murmured, "till the angels come," and
sunk exhausted into a slumber. Slowly and quietly
the children departed&mdash;and when next they looked
upon him he was shrouded for the grave. In a few
moments he awoke, and as he missed the little faces
that had been around him, a sad look rested for a moment
upon his face&mdash;but in an instant, as his eye
rested on his young sister, he smiled feebly, and exclaimed&mdash;"<i>They</i>
are all gone&mdash;yet my sweet Lillias
is with me still."</p>

<p>That night the angels kept vigil around his couch,
and ere morn arose upon the earth the unsullied
spirit was wafted to its native Heaven. Never&mdash;never
can <i>that</i> night of Death be effaced from the
tablets of memory&mdash;marked as it was by such holy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
heavenly heroism on the part of that fond and devoted
mother. Burning tears were on the father's cheek,
and the young Lillias had sobbed herself into a
feverish slumber, but until life was over <i>the mother</i>
sat by the side of her child, breathing sweet, low
whispers of the Better Land, so soon to be his home.
She faltered not, and although her heart seemed consuming
itself, she would still trace, with an eye of
faith, new rays of comfort for the dying one. She
could not bear to think that his childish heart should
shrink from the grave&mdash;nor think of it&mdash;invested as
it is so often&mdash;with dread and gloom. Thus she sustained
him to the very portals of Heaven, until he
needed earthly consolation no more, until the sheltering
arms of Him received him, who hath said&mdash;"Suffer
little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven."
As peacefully as a child sinks to rest on a mother's
bosom, sunk he into Death's embrace.</p>

<p>The agony of the hour, when it is said of a beloved
one, "he is dead," has never&mdash;nor can it be
justly portrayed. Then it is that Hope plumes her
wing and soars afar&mdash;then it is the even, the clear
eye of Faith seems dimmed. When the truth burst
upon the mother's heart that her child was no more&mdash;when
she felt that her grief had now no power to
afflict the childish heart that had idolized her&mdash;then
did the pent up torrents of agony rush forth, crushing
every barrier, and threatening to overwhelm her
soul in their mighty depth. Yet was she comforted&mdash;the
glorious imaginings that she had so faithfully
and forcibly portrayed to the dying one had fastened
upon her soul&mdash;and when the first wild burst of grief
was over, she turned from the coffined face to the
upper world, as though she would say, "not here&mdash;but
there."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Once more a childish group gathered around Willie
M&mdash;&mdash;. His eye smiled no welcome, his hand returned
no pressure, but as he lay enshrouded in the
garments of the grave, methought he was even more
lovely than when his face was glowing with life. A
smile still wreathed the parted lips, as though the
happy spirit had returned to the tenement of clay,
breathing of the blessedness of its glorious home.
Each imprinted a kiss on the placid brow, and as the
icy chill of death met their lips, so full of life and
warmth, the reality of their loss was felt by all.
Gary Lincoln lingered until she placed within those
little hands a cluster of white rose-buds&mdash;"Flowers,
pale flowers"&mdash;they were love's last gift.</p>

<p>Now came the hopeless anguish of the last look&mdash;the
suspension of almost life, as the dear remains are
lowered to their resting-place&mdash;and, worse than all,
the hollow, maddening sound of the falling earth upon
the coffin, sealing the doom of the bereaved, making
complete their misery. They laid him to rest amid
the bloom and shade of Mount Auburn, and his grave
is a shrine around which those who loved him come,
bringing ever with them the offering of gentle
thoughts and pleasant memories of him who sleeps
below. Little hands deck it with garlands, and sweet
Cary Lincoln has placed a tuft of early violets above
the sacred spot&mdash;for, said she, "Willie loved violets
so well."</p>

<p>For months after his death, during the "long bright
summer hours," a child was seen almost daily to
visit his grave, lingering when all had gone. It was
Lillias&mdash;and I thought if the departed spirit were
hovering near, how often it would echo those words,
"<i>They</i> are all gone, yet <i>thou</i>, my sweet Lillias, art
with me still."</p>

<p>One year had elapsed, and a funeral train wound
again through Mount Auburn, pausing at the grave
of Willie. Lillias was no more. She ceased not to
mourn for her brother, and during her last illness she
spoke of little, save that she should find him in
heaven. Once more that angel-mother sat by a
dying child, breathing words of holy hope and trust,
and her eye grew bright, and her heart was warm,
as she spoke of a joyful reunion in heaven.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said the child, "we will keep a place
for you and dear papa, and will you come soon?"</p>

<p>Years have since passed, but often at the holy twilight
hour those gentle children are with me still;
and when my rapt soul pierces the azure vault, I
seem to see Willie in angel robes, and listen, entranced,
to the tones of spirit-melody from his tiny
golden harp&mdash;a form as radiant as his own is ever
near him, and I fancy, as I mark the delighted look
that ever greets a seraph strain from the beloved lips,
that I hear in sweet tones, "<i>thou, my sweet Lilias,
art with me still</i>."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>ISOLETH.</h5>

<p>How shall I describe her? Who ever described
the sun, or one of the glorious stars, or the white,
witching moon; or who, even the least and simplest
of the exquisitely, perfectly fashioned wild-flowers,
that grow upon the humblest road-side? If these
are indescribable, how much more so, in its highest
perfection, is the most beautiful, most perfect of all
God's beautiful, perfect creations&mdash;woman? Who
ever depicted her one half as lovely and loving as
she is? Who ever, amid all the wild, rapturous
praise that has been so profusely lavished upon her,
said one half that is her due for her truth and gentleness
and beauty, her untiring devotion, her unwearying
patience, her ever unselfish forgetfulness of self,
her&mdash;,but what has been so many times vainly attempted,
<i>I</i> cannot accomplish. How, then, shall I
describe thee, beautiful Isoleth? Loveliest, lovingest,
glowing, glorious Lady Isoleth! Bright Lady Isoleth!&mdash;wild
as a hawk, and beautiful as Love. Thy
every motion was grace, thine every look was truth.
Bewitching little Isoleth! Her form was as lithe and
flexible as a willow bough, and light and graceful as
a young fawn's. Her queenly little head sat most
proudly upon the daintiest, softest, whitest neck
and bosom you ever saw. Two deep wells of light
and love were her eyes, revealing every feeling of
her beautiful soul. When she was sad, they looked
out, half shut, through their long shining lashes,
dewy, dark and tender; and when her mood grew
merry, they danced in very joy. None yet agreed
on their color. One would have sworn they were
the softest, warmest brown&mdash;he saw them only when
they were looking love, and he was&mdash;but of him
anon. Another would have told you they were pure,
clear blue&mdash;but he was the Lady Isoleth's confessor,
with her when her thoughts dwelt upon things holy.
By turns were they violet and gray, and all imaginable
colors, in fact, except, indeed, green, or any
other such unrighteous shade that eyes sometimes
take upon themselves. Then her little, ripe, tempting
mouth&mdash;ah! was it not just the mouth one loves
to kiss? small, dimpled, with soft, rose-red lips; and
tremulous ever&mdash;trembling with the love and gladness
that filled her young heart. Most beautiful was
the Lady Isoleth of Fernheath.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>THE BIRTH-DAY.</h5>

<p>"My lady!" exclaimed a bustling, good-natured
little old body, entering the room, which Wilhelm
Gottfried, Baron of Arnhiem&mdash;the Lady Isoleth's
uncle and guardian&mdash;ever pleased himself with calling
the Lady Isoleth's menagerie, because, forsooth, the
little lady delighted herself with feeding and taming
countless birds that had been brought from all the
known quarters of the globe. "My lady," spoke
she, "do you know that this is your ladyship's birth-day,
that you this day have arrived at an age which
behooves you to put away childish things, and take
upon yourself the cares that belong&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You wise, dear little nurse! don't put on so
much of the awful; don't talk of care, you make
me shiver at the bare idea.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where the bee sucks, there lurk I:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cowslip's bell I lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There I couch when owls do cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bat's back do I fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After summer merrily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merrily, merrily!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And thus merrily sung the little airy Ariel, dancing
around the room, scarce touching the floor as she sung.</p>

<p>"Bless her light, little, happy heart! What a sin
that love must come, and with love, the self-loving,
proud husband, that will bend that bright will to his
own; and then old age, and care, sure enough, and
wrinkles&mdash;and then that light, fairy-bounding step
will be slow and leaden, and that&mdash;alas! alas! that
such perfect beauty&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"What is that you are muttering about, nursey
dear? You must not let me see one sad look to-day,
for am I not this day sixteen&mdash;bright, merry sixteen!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear lady, sixteen to-day&mdash;sixteen to-day;"
and the little dame, recovered from her momentary
sadness, gave her lady a mysterious, quizzical
look, as she once more repeated, "sixteen
to-day!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear nurse, what would you have me do,
or what shall I leave off from doing, now that I have
grown so exceedingly old?" asked Isoleth, smiling
that precious smile of hers&mdash;ten thousand dimples
danced around it&mdash;ten thousand loves nestled in each
dimple.</p>

<p>"Sixteen to-day!" replied the queer little old
body, with what she meant for a very significant
look. "Your guardian, the noble Baron of Arnhiem,
comes this day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As he does every year to see me, dear nurse,
staying several weeks, sometimes months, with me."</p>

<p>"He comes not alone this year, my sweet lady,"
added the little woman, looking still more significantly.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall have my dear prim old maiden
aunt of Hansfeldt, with her snuff and lap-dogs, or is
it my dear, sweet, beautiful cousins Blumine and
Alida? Tell me, nursey, if they are coming. You
shake your head. I guess, then, my proud uncle
and aunt of Allwrath, and my aristocratic cousins,
their haughty sons and daughters?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>"None of them, sweet lady&mdash;that is, just yet."</p>

<p>"My beautiful, loving-cousin, Alice of Bernstorf,
who has been living these six years alone and lonely
in her castle with only her younger son and daughters.
Is she or any of hers coming here again? And when
will my cousins of Bernstorf return from those
hideous wars? I have not seen them for so many
years I should not know them."</p>

<p>"Now, dear lady, you are approaching nearer the
fire, as the children say in the play."</p>

<p>"You dear, queer little old nurse, don't look so
mystical and mystified, my circle of acquaintance,
by reason of my father's will, is not so very extensive
but that the roll might soon be gone through
with. Come, unfold thy important, mysterious
budget&mdash;who is it?"</p>

<p>"Who should it be, dear lady, but your noble
cousin, Ferdinand, Prince of Bernstorf! My lady,
there is a clause in your father's will, that you were
not to know until your sixteenth birth-day, revealing
a compact between your noble father and your
Cousin Ferdinand, the reigning Duke of Bernstorf,
that gave you as bride to your cousin, Prince Ferdinand
Of Bernstorf. There, now, my lady, 'tis out.
The secret has half-choked me these twelve years."</p>

<p>"Very kind and considerate in my father; but his
child does not choose to become the bride of any
one just yet, least of all of one old enough to be her
grandfather."</p>

<p>"Old!" exclaimed the dame, throwing back her
hands in amazement, "Old! why, my dear lady, he
is a mere boy; he will be but twenty-eight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight! and I sixteen! why they would
have me marry my grandfather." And the little
lady threw back her head, and with it its world of
soft brown curls, and laughed in very glee.</p>

<p>"He will be but twenty-eight, two&mdash;no, three days
after this coming Christmas. But, dear lady, do
leave these screaming, noisy jack-daws and mackdaws,
and come and let me dress you in the beautiful
new court-dress your guardian sent you this
morning."</p>

<p>"You naughty nurse! to abuse my beautiful birds.
I have only one jack-daw, and these are my pretty
West Indian macaws, <i>not</i> mackdaws, wise nursey.
And those are my bright-eyed canaries, and that is&mdash;but
you will not remember their names, although I
have told them to you so often."</p>

<p>"I see some are blue, and some bright red, and I
know that little Jenny, who helps you take care of
them, loves them as well as you do. But will you
not come now and try on your splendid dress? I
would have you look your best and prettiest when
your cousin comes."</p>

<p>"I know I shall not like him, and if I do not, my
guardian will not force me to marry him."</p>

<p>"But your father's will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not think of that now, nor will I dress,
dear nursey. I will go ride my pony, and gather
some of those wild-flowers my guardian loves so
well." And away flew the bright, happy little
maiden; she herself, of all the glad, sweet wild-flowers
that grew among the shades of Fernheath,
the gladdest, sweetest, merriest and wildest; and
the one of all the rest her guardian uncle loved
the best.</p>

<p>Little Dame Hildreth, while she flew about preparing
for the reception of Baron Arnhiem and the
prince, could not help sadly bemoaning the strange
perversity of her young lady, in preferring birds and
wild-flowers and ponies to court-dresses and husbands.</p>

<p>The Lady Isoleth soon forgot that she had arrived
at the advanced age of sixteen, and that she had to
put away childish things, and all about her father's
will, and the awful prince. She rode her pony
through the wood down to the sea; then ran a race
with him upon the beach&mdash;the pony playfully
allowing his mistress to win. She climbed the highest
rocks in search of wild-flowers, and wove the sweet
flowers into garlands; at length, recollecting how
long she had been gone from home, she mounted her
pony and galloped on toward the castle, her head
wreathed with holly, and her arms full of flowers.
As she entered the avenue there stood her impatient
nurse awaiting her.</p>

<p>"My dear, darling young lady, what an age you
have been away. We have all been watching&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has he come?"</p>

<p>"Who, the prince?"</p>

<p>"My dear uncle&mdash;has he come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dearest lady. They both came, Prince
Ferdinand and your guardian, soon after you left,
and have been here for three long mortal hours
waiting for you very anxiously. The prince looks
very noble and handsome, and is dressed most magnificently.
You must not be disappointed though,
dearest lady, for he is somewhat changed."</p>

<p>"Changed! How changed, dear nurse? I have
not seen him these six or seven years, ever since,
you remember the time, he and my cousin duke, his
father, with so many others, went to fight those horrid
Turks."</p>

<p>"He looks older, much older than he did&mdash;that,
though, must be&mdash;yes, it must be on account&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Older! why you simple, queer little nurse, he
<i>is</i> older. Why should he not look&mdash;I expect to see
him look half as old as Methuselah at least. How
shockingly old one must feel if they live to be twenty-eight."</p>

<p>"Yes, he <i>does</i> seem older than I expected to see
him&mdash;though, to be sure, he has been, for the last
seven years engaged in the wars; yes, that must be
it. Nothing makes one grow old so fast as fighting.
But, dear lady, come, now, and dress, there's a
darling. You will have just about time enough before
dinner. But where is your bonnet?"</p>

<p>"Up in the branch of a tree, nursey dear. It will
make some bird a delightful nest next spring. I lost
it getting this curious white flower. Look at it. It
grew in an almost inaccessible spot upon the cliff by
the sea."</p>

<p>"You are a dear little kid clambering among those
ugly rocks. Let me take some of your flowers,
your bundle is nearly as big as yourself. The saints
preserve us! if there are not your uncle guardian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and the prince! And you in such a tattered plight.
For the love of Heaven, dear lady, come in here
among these bushes until&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the little dame had to finish her speech to the
winds, for the impulsive Isoleth had sprung from her
pony, and was clasped in her guardian uncle's embrace
before her nurse was half through beseeching
her to hide.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear child, have you turned gipsy?
You are as ragged as one, and are as brown as a
berry. But I can see through your long, thick curls
that the last year has improved you most wonderfully.
Let me introduce you to your cousin, Ferdinand
of Bernstorf."</p>

<p>Isoleth looked up and beheld&mdash;gracious me! He
was every day as old as her guardian, and positively
had gray hairs. She was sure she saw white hairs
among his black curls. She could give him only
one glance, for his dark, handsome eyes were fastened
searchingly upon her. Her eyes fell beneath his admiring
gaze, and fell upon her torn muslin dress&mdash;the
rocks and briars had paid no respect to it&mdash;rather <i>had</i>
paid their best respects to it; and, without vouchsafing
a word in reply to her uncle or handsome
cousin, she sprung, light as a fawn, into her saddle,
and was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>"What say you, Cousin of Bernstorf, to such a
bride as that for the proposed alliance&mdash;a wild one,
is it not?"</p>

<p>"I like her exceedingly. By the holy mass! but
she is the most beautiful creature I ever saw. We
will take her to court, she will bewitch us all, old
and young. By my faith, but she is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she <i>is</i>," replied the baron, smiling at
Ferdinand's earnestness. I thought she would surprise
you. I cannot conceive of any thing one-half
so beautiful as she."</p>

<p>"Beautiful! you surprise me! Bless my soul! she is
radiant with beauty, and she is the greatest surprise
I ever had in my life. We will electrify the whole
court with surprise and delight at her wondrous
grace and beauty, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All in good time, noble cousin. You recollect
her father's will&mdash;that she should remain at Fernheath,
neither going from here, nor receiving much
company, save her own kinsfolk, until after her
marriage with your noble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I have not forgotten the will. 'So was
it nominated in the bond.' It delights me most exceedingly
that she is so marvelously beautiful. St.
Jerome! but I feel already that I love her as dearly
as though she were my own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, cousin! You always had a spice
of enthusiasm that is delightful and refreshing to me."
And the baron laughed right heartily because he was
delighted&mdash;and the laugh seemed to refresh him.
"After all," continued he, as soon as the corners of
his mouth had come within speaking distance of each
other, "after all, she is but an untrained country-girl;
she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nature, and her own beautiful soul, have given
her all the training she needs. Her wild, unconstrained
life, has developed her as no court or city
life could. That I can see, seeing her as little as I
have."</p>

<p>"You think just as I do, dear cousin. My brother's
will was a wise one, that kept her thus from the
deadening conventionalities of a court life."</p>

<p>"By my soul! how exceedingly lovely she is.
She surpasses all my expectations. I recollect her
as a little fairy thing of eight or ten. I have not seen
her until now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Since just before this last war, full seven years
ago."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>If Ferdinand of Bernstorf thought the little tattered
gypsey Isoleth so inconceivably lovely, his eyes
were half blinded with the radiant beauty of the
young Countess of Fernheath, as she entered the
dining-hall, clad in the shining court-robe her guardian
had sent her. Her cousin's dark eyes were
fastened upon her with a look of passionate admiration,
that caused the bright blood to burn on her face
and bosom. Nor did those handsome black eyes
scarce leave her during the whole long dinner. As
soon as she could release herself she hastened to her
only confidante, Dame Hildreth.</p>

<p>She found the little dame kneeling upon the floor,
busily engaged in unpacking boxes, while the floor
was literally alive with silks, and satins, and laces,
and woman's finery.</p>

<p>"See here, my lady&mdash;and here&mdash;and there! Look
what your uncle guardian of Arnheim has provided
for your approaching nuptials! And, dear lady, do
but look here;" and the eager, proud little dame
opened a casket of beautiful pearls&mdash;necklace, girdle,
coronet, brooch and armlets. This noble present
comes from the father of your betrothed. It is to be
followed by a still more beautiful set of diamonds."</p>

<p>"These pearls may deck my burial instead of my
bridal, for I never will live to wed with <i>him</i> below."</p>

<p>"Why, my sweetest lady!" exclaimed nurse Hildreth,
glancing up in surprise at her young mistress's
flushed and excited face. "For the love of
Heaven, do not talk in that way! What objection
can you possibly have to such a noble, handsome,
princely prince? He is the oldest son and heir to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oldest, indeed! He is old enough to be my
father's father."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! Lady Isoleth, you talk wild. I
will wager my life he is only twenty-eight, three
days after this coming Christmas. He has been in
the wars, you know&mdash;and war is no gentle nurse.
Exposure in the wars has caused him to appear
somewhat older than he is. You know, dearest lady,
that war&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he is gray&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exposure in the wars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And wrinkled&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exposure in the wars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there is that about him I never could love,
were he as young as&mdash;I never can love him&mdash;I
hate him, and I will not wed him."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, dear, dearest young lady, what
<i>will</i> you do?" The thought never entering her head
that the Lady Isoleth could do any thing but submit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
to the will of others; for woman in those times was
sought and given in marriage without often consulting
her own inclination.</p>

<p>What will I do, dear nurse? Why I will fall on
my knees at the feet of my beloved guardian and
plead with him. He never refused me any thing;
and I know he will grant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But your father's will, dearest lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall be put aside, where his daughter's happiness
is at stake."</p>

<p>"Would it may be as you wish, sweetest lady.
But I fear. Still he is a right noble prince, and will
make a right noble husband."</p>

<p>"<i>Not</i> for me."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>THE SURPRISE.</h5>

<p>In the saddest of sad moods the Lady Isoleth betook
herself to her favorite retreat among the rocks,
and there within her own little vine-covered bower,
was&mdash;not a bird, nor a squirrel, nor her tame deer&mdash;but
a man! young and wondrously handsome; with
a broad, pale, noble brow, and a host of jet-black
curls shading it. There was something in his clear,
dark eye, so still and serene as it gazed beyond this
world, and something in the expression of his fine,
manly face, so tender, so almost sad, that made her
forget to be afraid of him. She approached him
gently, and asked him in a soft voice,</p>

<p>"What are thy meditations, beautiful stranger?"</p>

<p>"I was dreaming of thee!" uttered he, awaking
from his reverie, and fixing his dark, earnest eyes
full upon the glowing form before him. His glance,
so full of passion, so full of tenderness, so fervent,
went to her heart and woke it up&mdash;that precious little
heart that had been sleeping for sixteen long years.</p>

<p>"Of me! How can that be?" asked Isoleth, with
a deep blush. "Dost thou know me? Dost thou&mdash;'</p>

<p>"One like thee, most beautiful being!"</p>

<p>"One like me&mdash;just like me? How strange! What
is her name?"</p>

<p>"Whatever is thy name, loveliest, most lovely
lady, is hers."</p>

<p>"My name is Isoleth," replied she, with a low
voice, and a deep blush.</p>

<p>"Art thou the Lady Isoleth of Fernheath? <i>Art</i>
thou? Stupid! that I did not see sooner that thou art!
Yes, thou art! And I am happy, most happy, most inconceivably
happy that thou art! Ah!" continued he,
in a tone of the most rapturous delight, "that my dream
and my bride should prove to be one and the same. I
am most inexpressibly joyful!"&mdash;and the large tears
fell from his eyes like summer rain&mdash;"most unutterably&mdash;and
thou, wilt thou love me, and be mine, my
glorious, sweetest, loveliest cousin&mdash;my most, most
beautiful bride!"</p>

<p>"Thy cousin! thy bride! Alas! alas! thy cousin
I may be, but thy bride&mdash;! They are going to marry
me up there at the castle to an old, ugly, cross prince;
he is there now, and you cannot know how much I
hate him. I will die&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil they are! Forgive me, sweetest,
most beautiful cousin, it is a foolish way we learn
of speaking in camps. But, loveliest, do not talk of
dying, let the old and the ugly die, but thou&mdash;First
tell me who this ugly, old, cross prince is, they shall
not marry you to any such."</p>

<p>"Why he is not so very ugly&mdash;and I do not exactly
know that he is cross; but then he is old, very old&mdash;yes,
very old and very disagreeable&mdash;and I never
can love him."</p>

<p>"Nor shalt thou&mdash;his name, most beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Ferdinand, Prince of Bernstorf."</p>

<p>"Ferdinand, prince of ten thousand devils! I
beseech of thee to forgive me once again, sweetest
cousin; but thou dost petrify me. Ferdinand, Prince
of &mdash;&mdash; Ah! it must be&mdash;yes, yes, it must be so."</p>

<p>"What must be? Thou speakest in riddles,
stranger cousin."</p>

<p>"And thou lovest him not, nor dost thou wish to
wed him?" asked the stranger, an almost provoking
smile just curling his handsome mouth.</p>

<p>"No, no, never&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Nor shalt thou ever!" exclaimed he, his manner
changing to one of serious earnestness. Nor shalt
thou ever, dearest, most beautiful&mdash;for <i>I</i> will prevent
it, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou? Alas! alas! I have been betrothed to
him ever since I was an infant. How could my dear
father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest cousin, trust to me&mdash;wilt thou not?
And, dearest, sweetest cousin, love me, and be my
beautiful wife. Nay, shake not thy loveliest head.
Have I been too hasty in urging my love? I have
known thee, and loved thee, for so many years;
thou hast, thy beautiful spirit has ever, night and
day, been near me, the light of my life; but I have
frightened thee by my impetuosity&mdash;and thou canst
never love me? But, no, thy beautiful eyes look
tenderly upon me; and thou wouldst not let me hold
this little soft, warm hand, and imprison it within
mine, if thou didst hate me. I do not lightly ask that
precious boon, thy love. Believe me, it is as I say,"
continued he, earnestly bending upon her his deep,
dark, eloquent eyes&mdash;eyes that made her little heart
thrill to its very core. "It is as I tell thee, thou hast
been my dream by day and by night. See here," and
he drew from his bosom a small miniature, and
handed it to her&mdash;the exact image of&mdash;herself. "And
now I will tell thee what I never before told
mortal being. Just three years ago, after a fatiguing
day's fight, I lay in my tent, awake; and thou didst
come to me, just as thou now dost appear&mdash;a vision
of light and purity and glorious loveliness. Whether
it was a dream or not, or a trance, I know not; but
never since has that radiant vision left me. Thou
didst lay thy little soft, white hand upon my fevered
brow, and I heard most distinctly, as thy sweet face
bent over me, these words: 'Do not love other than
me, for I alone, on earth, am destined for thee.'
From my earliest boyhood have I loved to use the
pencil; and on the next morning I tried, and succeeded
in conveying to this bit of ivory the image
of that most, most beautiful vision; and I have worn
it upon my heart ever since, where I would the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
loved, deeply, dearly loved and beautiful original
might ever be. From then till now have I worn
next to my heart that semblance of my nightly, daily
dream; but never until now have I been blessed in
seeing my dream, living, breathing before me."</p>

<p>How that young heart throbbed and bounded,
almost suffocating its loving, lovely owner with the
intensity of its joyous emotion, as the earnest tones
of that low, passionate voice fell, word by word,
into its inmost centre, as the glance of those deeply,
deeply loving eyes awoke it to life and love. Her
hand lay within his, and by little he drew her more
and more closely and warmly to his heart, and by
little her head gradually sunk upon his manly breast,
her eyes looked up tenderly and trustingly into his
and drank in his passionate gaze, as though it were
her life. Time flew by them unheeded, each pouring
out joy and life into the heart of the other.
Their very being melting and mingling each into the
other, until each felt that their two lives were one.
Nor did he sully those pure, exquisite lips, with one
earthly kiss. His soul kissed hers, and her own
vibrated to his in trembling unison.</p>

<p>Such moments of intense soul-rapture do not often
occur to many of us on earth, for perfect love seeks
perfect fulfillment; and in the perfect fulfillment of
love is too often the satiety that deadens its finest,
most spiritual impulses.</p>

<p>The castle gong sounded, booming heavily through
the trees. Isoleth started to her feet like a frightened doe.</p>

<p>"I must go," exclaimed she, "my guardian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay one moment, sweetest, I have something to
tell thee, that thou must hear."</p>

<p>"I have staid too long already," interrupted she,
hastily, "my guardian will be sending out for me&mdash;it
is already growing dark. Fare thee well;" and she
gave him a farewell with her soft, brown eyes that
never left his heart&mdash;so full of unconscious love
was it.</p>

<p>"You will meet me here again to-morrow morning?
Promise me at least so much, dearest beloved."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," and with another glance from her soft,
bright eyes, she glided out of his sight.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>SUSPENSE.</h5>

<p>"I am glad to see thee safely at home, my dear
child. Where hast thou been? Thou knowest I
hate to have thee rambling about the castle-grounds
after night-fall. I have already sent out to seek
thee, and was on the point of going in search of thee
myself. But, dear child, if walking at any time will
bring thee home with such a radiant, glowing color,
I shall not quarrel with the cause or hour. Thou
art looking as bright and as happy and beautiful as I
hope always to see thee look."</p>

<p>"I was afraid, dear uncle," replied Isoleth, blushing
still more deeply, and casting her conscious, love-full
eyes to the ground, "I was afraid thou wouldst
begin to be uneasy about me, and I hastened&mdash;I have
no one, dearest uncle, when thou art away, to take
such good care of me. I go wandering about among
my favorite haunts at my own good will and pleasure,
night or day, as it happens."</p>

<p>"The time is coming, eh! sweet Isoleth, when
thou wilt have to consult another will save thine
own," said the baron, patting her fondly on her soft,
white neck.</p>

<p>Ferdinand laughed, and looked very impressed
and impressive, and gazed her out of countenance
with assured, admiring eyes, as he answered for her,</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we are waiting only for the goodly
company that are to witness the approaching nuptials.
Is it not so, fairest lady?"</p>

<p>"The hideous being!" thought Isoleth, without
vouchsafing an audible reply. "Is this the one with
whom I am to spend my days&mdash;but no, it shall
not be."</p>

<p>She did the honors of the supper-table with a
suffocating throat, with a proud rebellious heart, full
of love for one she felt she ought not to love, and full
of hate for another that she knew she ought to love.
She was absent in spite of herself, and did all manner
of queer things that people do, who, for a time, take
leave of absence of themselves&mdash;answering yes, for
no&mdash;and no, for yes&mdash;attempting to bite a piece out
of her little porcelain cup-plate, instead of the cook's
snowy cake; pouring her guardian's cup up with
cream instead of coffee, and sweetening it with salt
instead of sugar. Many other little pleasantries of
like nature did she perform, very much to the amusement
of her guardian and the hated Ferdinand. The
latter made himself exceeding merry at her expense,
at the same time showing her every attention and
gallantry that he, finished courtier, could devise.
Isoleth felt at length completely worried and tired to
death, as though she could not for one moment
longer, endure the torture of her heart's conflicting
emotion.</p>

<p>"You look pale and tired, my beloved child,"
said her guardian, tenderly taking her little cold,
white hand within his. All your beautiful color is
gone. I fear that after all your walk, or the excitement,
has been too much for you. You had best
retire for the night. Shall I ring for Dame Hildreth,
or some of your maidens?"</p>

<p>"No, dear uncle, with your permission, I will
seek those I wish," answered Isoleth, only too glad
to escape from the hated presence into the calm
stillness of her own room.</p>

<p>She found the good little dame awaiting her; and
to her compassionate ear she poured forth the sorrow
and joy of her young heart. The kind-hearted little
woman sympathized cordially with her precious
foster-child, wishing over and over again that some
benevolent fairy would change the beautiful stranger
cousin with the hateful old Prince Ferdinand&mdash;she
had to acknowledge that he did <i>look</i> old&mdash;until after
the happy wedding was over. "And then how
blank and black the prince would look, and how
astonished we all would be to find you had married
the handsome young man instead of the grumpy
old one."</p>

<p>"Now leave me, good nurse, I would be alone.
I will entreat my dear uncle on the morrow to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
release me from this dreaded alliance. He never
yet refused a request of mine."</p>

<p>Isoleth quieted herself in the belief that her beloved
guardian would certainly grant her petition as
soon as she made it known to him. In child-like
confidence, therefore, she sunk to her happy sleep,
with a pair of dark, loving eyes hovering over her
and mingling with her dreams. And never eyes
gazed on more gentle sleep or lovely sleeper.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>THE APPEAL.</h5>

<p>With a buoyant step and a sparkling eye the Lady
Isoleth sought her guardian early the next morning.
He was deeply immersed in papers and parchments,
while huge, formidable-looking books were piled
high around him. He nevertheless welcomed his
sweet niece with a sudden clearing off of his thought-lined
brow, and a fond, affectionate smile.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, dearest uncle, if I have disturbed
thy studies; but I would see thee alone, and I feared
this might be the only opportunity, as the carriages
containing our kinsfolk are even now expected; so
nurse Hildreth informed me."</p>

<p>"What would my pet bird have that she seeks her
uncle thus early?"</p>

<p>"A boon that you must grant, dearest uncle, for
upon it depends my heart's happiness now and
forever."</p>

<p>"Name it, my darling Isy&mdash;what wouldst thou
have, little enthusiast?"</p>

<p>"Release from one I never can love. Oh! my
dearest uncle," continued she, fondly twining her
soft, white arms around his neck, and lovingly kissing
his time-worn brow, "do, for Heaven's sweet love,
tell me at once that I need not wed him, for I never
can love him&mdash;never, never!"</p>

<p>"Bless her little heart, what is the child raving
about? Whom dost thou mean, dear baby, by <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"Who should I mean, dearest uncle, but my cousin,
this Prince Ferdinand. I <i>need</i> not be his wife. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thy cousin, Prince Ferdinand!"</p>

<p>"I hate him&mdash;I abhor him&mdash;I utterly detest him!
I never can love him! I never will be his wife! I
never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold, hold! not so fast; why thou romantic little
recluse! thou hast lived alone too much by half.
Thy little head is brim full of fancies. Thy tongue
is running wild. Thou <i>hatest</i> him! Why what
wouldst thou have better? Is he not all a woman
could desire? Is he not young and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Young!"</p>

<p>"And handsome, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Handsome!"</p>

<p>"And is he not a prince? And is he not heir to a
powerful, wealthy ducal throne? And will he not
take thee to court&mdash;the gay, beautiful court; and
wilt thou not reign there a queen&mdash;a queen of beauty
and joy and light&mdash;and ere long queen of the
throne?"</p>

<p>"All that does not dazzle me, dearest uncle&mdash;for
what are thrones and splendor where love is not?
Oh! dear, dearest uncle, do not press this hated
match upon me. Do not doom me to eternal sorrow.
Do not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hoity, toity! Why thou dost talk just as they
do in those silly romances. I wager thy head is full
of them. Thou hast had bad teachers, child, to
permit thee to fill thy poor little brain with such
trash instead of useful knowledge. Or is it," said
he, fixing his gray eyes searchingly upon her, "or is
it that thou hast met some sighing Adonis in the
woods? Ha! thou dost blush&mdash;have a care, child.
There, thou needest not tremble, I will not seek to
know thy secret, if secret thou hast. This much,
however, know for a certainty, that Prince Ferdinand
is destined to be thy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest uncle!" exclaimed the little lady, her
beautiful eyes filling with tears, "thou shalt know
all&mdash;all I have to tell, if thou wilt but deliver me
from this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have done with this folly, Lady Isoleth," and
his cold gray eyes sternly regarded her. "It was
thy dead father's will that thou shouldst marry thy
cousin, Prince Ferdinand of Bernstorf; and thy
father's will must and shall be obeyed."</p>

<p>"'Folly!' 'Lady Isoleth!' 'must and shall!' He
never before now spoke one unkind word to me."
And the weeping Isoleth went with a breaking heart
and shut herself in her own room, alone, and locking
herself in, she gave unrestrained vent to her passionate
grief.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>THE LAST APPEAL.</h5>

<p>"I will seek <i>him</i>&mdash;yes, <i>he</i> will not refuse my
prayer. I will tell him I hate him. He will be only
too glad to release me when he knows the depth of
hatred I bear him. I will go this moment, for soon
will all my gay cousins be here, and then will be the
horrid betrothal ceremony&mdash;but I will not think of
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! my shy, beautiful cousin, Lady Isoleth!"
Ferdinand was in the library, amusing himself with
books and prints. "See here, beautiful cousin, I
have found a book of rare merit, and beautifully
illuminated. I suppose, though," continued he with
a quizzical look, "that all the books here and their
manifold contents are familiar to thy bright eyes&mdash;is
it not so?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly <i>all</i>," replied Isoleth, smiling in spite
of her sorrow, as she glanced at the endless rows of
huge leather-bound tomes, that had not even had the
cobwebs dusted from them for a century at least.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou not deign to look over this precious
book with me, most beauteous lady? Thy sharp
wit may help my slow faculties to comprehend its
quaint poetry, and thy glorious eyes will love its
finely executed prints."</p>

<p>"I came not to disturb thy meditations," replied
she, shrinking from his approaching steps. I came
to crave a boon from thee."</p>

<p>"It is granted thee, fairest lady, even before thou
dost utter it. But what is it, the most beautiful, most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
lovely of her beautiful, lovely sex would ask? Be it
even unto the half of my kingdom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not the half of thy kingdom, but the whole
of it, together with thy kingdom's lord, that I would
be freed from."</p>

<p>"Thou art pleased to be facetious, most charming
Lady Isoleth. Pray explain thyself, that my dull
understanding may comprehend thy meaning."</p>

<p>"Ferdinand, Prince of Bernstorf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is one that I never, never can love&mdash;one that I
had rather should see me in the grave ere he shall call
me wife."</p>

<p>"Ha! well, loveliest cousin, that is plain, and easy
to be understood even by the slowest comprehension.
Thou hatest him, dost thou?"</p>

<p>"Most cordially."</p>

<p>"My son thanks thee, fair cousin&mdash;and I also, in
his name."</p>

<p>"Thy son!"</p>

<p>"Ay, and here he is to thank thee himself. How
now, scapegrace! Thou art tardy in paying thy respects
to this beautiful, noble lady. Thou shouldst
have been here days ago. Even now thy fair cousin
was on the point of refusing thee. I tell thee, lad,
thou'lt never find a fairer. Courting was not done
in this slipshod way when I was a boy."</p>

<p>All this while Isoleth was gazing in mute astonishment
upon&mdash;yes, she was not mistaken&mdash;he was the
very one&mdash;the very most beautiful being to whom
she had given, only the night before, her precious
little heart. And those dark, earnest eyes were
passionately regarding her, drinking in rapturously
her glowing beauty, until her eyes, abashed, sought
the floor, unable to bear the light of those intensely
loving ones.</p>

<p>"Then thou'rt the <i>Duke</i> of Bernstorf, my father's
cousin?" suddenly asked she, of Ferdinand the elder.</p>

<p>"Who else, fairest cousin? Ha! thou didst then
think&mdash;" a sudden light seemed to break through the
chambers of his brain. "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed he,
"Thou thoughtest that <i>I</i> was the one. I could not
wish a fairer, more beautiful bride than thou; but&mdash;ha!
ha! ha! I have one goodly wife already, who is
to be here this very day; and, between you and I,
one is more than I can manage, although she is one
of the best of her perfect, bewitching sex. Still&mdash;So,
that was the reason thou wert so shy of me,
sweet flower." And the father, Ferdinand, threw
himself back in his chair, and gave way to the most
uncontrollable bursts of laughter; while Ferdinand,
the son, had taken the soft, lily-white hand of his
lovely betrothed, and was talking to her in words
from his heart's heart.</p>

<p>"I should have told thee all this last evening if
thou couldst have waited but one instant longer. I
was to have accompanied my father and thy guardian
here; but I dreaded so much to see my affianced
bride&mdash;not dreaming until last evening that my beloved
and betrothed were one and the same&mdash;that my
beautiful dream was a more beautiful reality. If I
had come and found the young Countess of Fernheath
one that I could not have loved, I should certainly
have moved earth and heaven but that I would
have had the contract, made by our goodly sires,
annulled&mdash;or I would have drowned or shot myself.
Don't shudder, sweetest, I shall do neither now,
unless I am shot by the lightning of your bright eyes,
and drowned in the bliss&mdash;but, dearest, I love you
too dearly to speak nonsense to thee&mdash;even love
nonsense. Strange, was it not, darling, that I should
not have recognized you? It has been many a long
year since I saw you a little rosy, romping, fairy
thing of only a few bright summers. We have had
troublous times since then; war and bloodshed that
would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, most beautiful cousin, my long
laughter hath been rude; but, indeed, thy mistake
was most droll. There, sweet cousin, I have done!
Thy blushes, however, are exceedingly becoming
thy fair face. So thou and my goodly son hast met
before&mdash;is it not so? And he is not the laggard in
love I unjustly deemed him. And now I suppose the
best thing for me to do is to take myself off to another
world, and resign my kingdom and crown in
this for one in the&mdash;however, we will arrange all
that after the wedding. Let us, meantime, enjoy the
present. Ah! here comes thy good uncle with a
cloudy brow; something has gone wrong with him&mdash;we
must have no gloom to-day. And here also comes
thundering down the avenue all the goodly old
carriages containing our expected kinsfolk."</p>

<p>And here also comes,</p>


<h4>CHAPTER THE LAST,</h4>

<p>Which I know will delight you, dearest reader, as it
containeth the wedding; but most especially will it
delight you because it <i>is</i> the last. The wedding was
of course a splendid one, and better still, a joyous
one. Little Dame Hildreth would let no one but herself
fasten so much as a bridal ornament on her
beautiful young foster-child. It would be hard saying
which moved fastest on the important day, her hands
or her tongue.</p>

<p>"Just to think!" exclaimed she, as she clasped
those same pearls, that had once been cast aside in
scorn, upon her darling&mdash;and pure and lovely they
shone among her soft, brown curls, and on her snow-white
arms and neck, and around her lithe and
slender waist&mdash;"to think that I could have mistaken
Ferdinand, the reigning Duke of Bernstorf, for Ferdinand,
the Prince. Really, though, my lady, to
look at them, one does not see much difference in
their appearance&mdash;they are both so handsome and
grand-looking. Oh, yes! <i>you</i> see a vast odds in
their looks&mdash;that's natural! These old eyes, I suppose,
are growing dim&mdash;but they are bright enough
to see that thou art the dearest, loveliest, most
beautiful bride that ever the sun shone upon."</p>

alt="THE RUFFED GROUSE OR PHEASANT" title="" /></div>
<h4>THE RUFFED GROUSE OR PHEASANT.</h4>
<br />

<p>In the Eastern States the true partridge is known
by the name of quail, the appellation of partridge being
there given to what in Pennsylvania is called
the pheasant, and which in the Ornithologies bears
the name of the Ruffed Grouse, (<i>Tetrao Umbellus.</i>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>.) It inhabits a very extensive range of
country, being found at Hudson's Bay, in Kentucky
and Indiana, Oregon and the Floridas. Its
favorite places of resort are high mountains covered
with the balsam, pine, hemlock and other evergreens,
and as we descend from such heights to the lower
country they become more rare; and in the Carolinas,
Georgia and Florida they are very scarce. The
manners of the pheasant are solitary, they are seldom
found in coveys of more than four or five together,
and more usually in pairs, or singly. They
are often shot in the mornings in the roads over the
mountains bounding the Susquehanna; where they
come for gravel. On foggy mornings very considerable
numbers may be seen in these situations, moving
along with great stateliness, their broad fan-like
tail expanded to its fullest extent. The <i>drumming</i>
of the pheasant, a sound compared by Wilson to that
produced by striking two full blown ox bladders together,
but much louder; the strokes at first slow and
distinct, but gradually increasing in rapidity till they
run into each other, resembling the rumbling sound
of very distant thunder dying away gradually on the
ear. This drumming is the call of the male bird to
his mate, and may be heard in a calm day nearly half
a mile. Wilson thus describes the manner in which
this singular noise is produced. The bird, standing
on an old prostrate log, generally in a retired and
sheltered situation, lowers his wings, erects his expanded
tail, contracts his throat, elevates two tufts
of feathers on the neck, and inflates his whole body
something in the manner of the turkey-cock, strutting
and wheeling about with great stateliness. After a
few man&oelig;uvres of this kind he begins to strike with
his stiffened wings in short and quick strokes, which
become more and more rapid until they run into each
other, as has been already described. This is most
common in the morning and evening, though Wilson
states that he has heard them drumming at all hours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of the day. By means of this the pheasant leads the
gunner to the place of his retreat, though to those
unacquainted with the sound there is great deception
in the supposed distance, it generally appearing to
be much nearer than it really is. Audubon mentions
having often called them within shot by imitating the
sound. This he accomplished by beating a large inflated
bullock's bladder with a stick, keeping up as
much as possible the same time as that in which the
bird beats. At the sound produced by the bladder
and the stick, the male grouse, inflamed with jealousy,
has flown directly toward him, when, being prepared
beforehand, he has easily shot it. When flushed, the
pheasant flies with great vigor through the woods,
beyond the reach of view, springing up at first within
a few yards, with a loud whirring noise. Noticing
this peculiarity of flight, Mr. Audubon states that
when this bird rises from the ground at a time when
pursued by an enemy, or tracked by a dog, it produces
a loud whirring sound resembling that of the
whole tribe, excepting the black-cock of Europe,
which has less of it than any other species. The
whirring sound is never heard when the grouse rises
of its own accord, for the purpose of removing from
one place to another; nor, in similar circumstances,
is it commonly produced by our little partridge. "In
fact," he continues, "I do not believe that it is emitted
by any species of grouse, unless when surprised
and forced to rise. I have often been lying on the
ground in the woods or the fields, for hours at a time,
for the express purpose of observing the movements
and habits of different birds, and have frequently seen
a partridge or a grouse rise on wing within a few
yards of the spot where I lay, unobserved by them,
as gently and softly as any other bird, and without
producing any whirring sound. Nor even when this
grouse ascends to the top of a tree does it make any
greater noise than other birds of the same size
would do."</p>

<p>With a good dog, pheasants are easily found, and
what is singular, they will look down upon him from
the branches of a tree, where they sit, apparently
stupefied, not attempting to fly, but allowing themselves
to be shot one by one until all are killed.
Should one of those on the higher branches, however,
be shot first, the sight of his fall will cause an
immediate flight. A figure 4 trap is used with success
in taking them, especially when deep snow lies
on the ground. They were formerly numerous in
the immediate vicinity of Philadelphia, but the advances
of the agriculturist have led them to retreat
to the interior, and but a very few can be now found
within several miles. The pheasant is in the best
order in September and October, but in mid-winter
those who shoot them should be careful to draw them
as soon as possible, as the buds of laurel on which at
that season they sometimes feed, if left in the stomach
of the dead bird, diffuse their poisonous qualities
over its whole body, and render it dangerous
food.</p>

alt="AMERICAN PARTRIDGE, OR QUAIL" title="" /></div>
<h4>AMERICAN PARTRIDGE, OR QUAIL. (<i>Perdrix Virginianus.</i> <span class="smcap">Wilson.</span>)]</h4>
<br />

<p>This well known bird, though not very migratory
in its habits, has extended its colonies from New
England to Mexico. The spot where they have
been raised, if they can at all support life, is their
home; and there they will remain until the whole flock
is destroyed by sportsmen. This fact sufficiently
disproves the asserted identity of our partridge with
the quail of the European continent, which is a bird
of passage, leaving Europe for Asia at the approach
of winter, and returning in very great numbers in the
spring. Partridges assemble in small families, varying
according to circumstances from three to thirty;
and, except in the breeding season, they all live together
in a happy and mutual alliance. The quails
on the other hand are pugnacious to a proverb&mdash;"as
quarrelsome as quails in a cage."</p>

<p>The partridges are nearly full grown by the beginning
of September, and associated in the usual coveys
of from twenty to thirty afford considerable sport to
the gunner. The notes of the males at this time are
frequent, clear and loud, and they may by skillful
imitation of the call be deceived and induced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
approach. Their food consists of grain seed, insects
and berries of various kinds. The buckwheat fields
suffer severely from their depredations in September
and October, affording them at that time abundant
food and secure shelter. At night they roost in the
middle of a field, on high ground, sitting round in a
circle with their heads outward. In this position
they place themselves at the commencement of a fall
of snow, when their mutual warmth is the better
able to resist the effects of frost, and each forms a
guard for the whole against the approach of danger.
They are not afraid of snow, for they sometimes fly to
a drift for safety; it being only when a coating of frozen
sleet resists their efforts to leave it that they experience
bad effects from it. The loud whirring sound
of their flight when flushed is well known. Its steady,
horizontal flight renders it an easy prey to the sportsman,
especially when he is assisted by a sagacious
dog. The flesh of the partridge is peculiarly white,
tender and delicate, in this respect unequaled by any
other American game.</p>

<h4>THE AMERICAN ROBIN. (<i>Turdus Migratorius.</i>)]</h4>
<br />

<p>This well known bird, and universal favorite, can
require but a very few words at our hands. His unassuming
familiarity of manners has caused him to
be immortalized in the Songs for the Nursery, and
others of Mother Goose's collections for the little
ones. His nest is preserved from the rude hands of
boyhood by a sort of instinctive veneration for his
well known and long established character, and
his cheerful, zealous singing not unfrequently causes
the older sportsman to take down the armed gun
from his shoulder, and suffer the assiduous songster
to enjoy his liberty and life.</p>

<p>The robin is particularly fond of gum-berries, and
it is only necessary for the sportsman to take his
stand near one of these trees when it is covered with
fruit, and load and fire his gun. One flock after another
will come to it without intermission during the
whole day.</p>

<h4>BY J. BAYARD TAYLOR.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<p>[The Hindoo philosopher Gautama, now worshiped under the name of Buddha, lived in the fifth century before Christ.
He taught the unity of God and Nature, or rather, that the physical and spiritual worlds are merely different conditions
of an eternal Being. In the spiritual state, this Being exists in perfect and blissful rest, whose emanations and over-flowings
enter the visible world, first in the lowest forms of nature, but rising through gradual and progressive changes
till they reach man, who returns after death to the original rest and beatitude.]</p>

<h4>BY THE AUTHOR OF KATE WALSINGHAM.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Oh, there is many a spot in this every-day world of ours
as bright and beautiful as those of which we dream, or go
miles away to visit and admire; but we must seek for them
in the right spirit, ere the dimness will pass away from eyes
blinded by the love of foreign novelties. Our own land,
ay, even our own city&mdash;the crowded mart of commerce, and
the vast haunt of poverty and crime, is rich in many a quiet
nook, which, although it might arrest the attention if depicted
on the gemmed page of the picturesque annual by
some summer tourist, it is considered plebeian to notice as
we pass them in our daily walks.</p>

<p>We have sat beneath the vines and blue skies of Italy,
and heard from her moonlight balconies such strains as
made us hold our breath to listen that we might not lose a
note ere the perfumed breeze bore it lingeringly away:
and in after years, in those English balconies we have described,
wept, beneath the same moon, tears that had more
of joy than grief in them, at some rude and simple strain
which, sung by loved lips, made the charm of our careless
and happy childhood. We have stood awe-stricken before
the walls of the Colosseum, at Rome, and dreamt of it for
evermore! But we have likewise paused opposite the Colosseum
in the Regent's Park, investing it in the dim
twilight with a thousand beauties that made it an object of
interest. We can well remember lingering in the neighborhood,
before the mimic church, or convent, as we had
been taught to call it, of St. Catharine, with the moonshine
gleaming through its arches, and the flickering lights appearing
here and there in the diamond-paned windows,
watching eagerly for the appearance of those white-robed
nuns with which our childish fancy had peopled that quiet
place&mdash;wondering that they never came. And amid all
the architectural glory of foreign churches and cathedrals,
since visited, have failed again to realize that simple love
of, and faith in the beautiful, which then invested every
scene with its peculiar charm. Where the mind makes its
own picturesque, it never yet failed to find materials, and
is often gifted with a strange power to charm others into
seeing with its own loving eyes! So the poet immortalizes
the humble home of his boyhood, and in after years men
make pilgrimages to the time-worn stile, the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Rustic bridge&mdash;the willow tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bathing its tresses in the quiet brook;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which his genius has redeemed from obscurity, and rendered
hallowed spots for evermore.</p>

<h4>BY LADY GEORGIANA FULLERTON.</h4>

<p>How strange it is to those who are in some sense new
to the world, to see the way in which time plasters over
wounds which we should have imagined that nothing
could have healed: wounds which we should have expected
to see bleed afresh at the sight of the inflictor, as it
was said of old that those of the murdered did at the approach
of the murderer. Sometimes we almost feel as if
nothing was real in that singular existence called <i>the world</i>.
Like the performers, who laugh and talk behind the scenes
after the close of some dreadful tragedy; we see around
us men who have ruined the fortunes and destroyed the
happiness of others, women who have betrayed and been
betrayed, whose existence has been perhaps devoted to
misery and to infamy by the first step they have taken in
the path of guilt, and whose hearts, if they did not break
grew hard; we see the victims and the destroyers, those
who have loved and those who have hated, those who have
injured and those who have been injured, mix together in
the common thoroughfares of life, meet even in social intimacy,
with offered hands and ready smiles; not because
"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy;"
not because "To those who forgive, shall much be forgiven;"
but because what is genuine and true, what is
deep and what is strong, takes no root in that worn-out
soil on which we tread, thrives not in that withering air
which we breathe in that fictitious region which we live in,
and which we so emphatically and so presumptuously call
<i>the world</i>.</p>

<h4>BY G. P. R. JAMES.</h4>

<p>He was a fool, and not a philosopher, who said that
uncertainty was the just condition of man's mind. In
trust, in confidence, in firm conviction, and in faith, is only
to be found repose and peace. Assurance is what man's
heart and understanding both require, and the very
fact of the mind not being capable of obtaining certainty
upon many points, is a proof of weakness, not of
strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Close of the Year.</span>&mdash;The year is closing on us&mdash;and
the change suggests reflections, which, if rather melancholy,
may nevertheless be profitable. We acknowledge
that the divisions of time are rather arbitrary&mdash;and
therefore may vary, as they do vary, in different parts of
the world. But whenever we arrive at one of these important
epochs, whatever that may be, and wherever it
constitutes a point in the popular calendar, we have passed
one period of our life, and have so much the less to spend.</p>

<p>If we <i>feel</i> the rapidity of time's march in our ordinary
festivity, and regret the approaching dissolution of the
pleasant assembly, by how much the more do we feel if
we pause to think that we are approaching the time when
all our associations in life must cease, and we be remembered&mdash;not
known&mdash;and that remembrance day by day
growing less and less distinct, as new objects occupy the
public eye, or new associations are taken up by those we
leave. Nor would we "jump the life to come," by neglecting
to make our approximation to that an occasion for
such a solicitude as would lead to a preparation.</p>

<p>But we would not have all those reflections gloomy.
We would not cloud the close of the year, nor the evening
of life with moroseness, as if all were vanity that we had
enjoyed, and all were vexation of spirit that was left.
Such a use of the season would be a poor return for all the
good things which Providence has wrought in our behalf.
We know at this season of the year that the mountain
summits are covered with snow, and in some places the
drooping sides are whitened with the treasures of the
clouds, but even these things, chilling as they may appear,
are good in their season, and the beauteous covering of the
hill-tops may glisten with the reflected rays of the sun, and
seem to enjoy the visiter that has descended upon them.
All the trees that yield their leaves to the season have for
weeks been bare, ready to receive the weight of snow
which might fall upon them, and teaching man that preparation
is necessary to meet the evils of life and sustain its
burthens. Here and there a few evergreens retain their
foliage, and appear doubly beautiful amid the waste that is
around them.</p>

<p>But it is not alone for their beauty that these objects are
worthy of consideration&mdash;they teach also. They are full
of instruction. Every leaf that glistens with winter's frost,
or is crushed dry and rustling beneath our feet, has its lesson&mdash;it
is well that all do not retain their position&mdash;they
would be less monitory, less worthy our thought. Nature,
in her use of foliage, acts upon the plan which the sybil of
old adopted&mdash;she writes her lessons upon the leaves&mdash;and
yet so arranges the truths they should convey, that they
become more and more apparent, more and more valuable,
as the hand of destructive time diminishes their number.</p>

<p>Elsewhere we have given reflections upon those events
by which kingdoms and empires have been shaken in the
year now coming to a close. Let us come nearer the heart,
and speak of some of those changes by which human affections
and individual attachments have been disturbed. Not,
however, to quote the instance exactly&mdash;that would be to
drag up into life the hidden sorrow, and expose to observation
the grief which is sanctified for the recesses of the
heart, whither in moments of leisure the wounded retire
and sit and brood in profitable reflection over the affliction
which Providence has allowed. We dare not drag up to
day and its exposure each grief that lies buried deep in the
grave of the mourner's heart. How truly beautiful, however,
is the reflection that the stone of the sepulchre may
be rolled away, and that in appropriate seasons the afflicted
one makes a retreat from the business and the pleasures of
life, and "goeth unto the grave to weep there." Sanctified&mdash;as
beautiful&mdash;be the sorrow that hath not its exponent
in the public assembly, that hath no signal by which
its existence is to be denoted&mdash;no condition of countenance
by which its extent is to be measured. Perhaps the <i>sufferer</i>
had not yet obtained permission to call the object hers&mdash;and
thus is deprived of the privilege of admitted mourning&mdash;how
deep is <i>that</i> grief&mdash;it has known only the hope of life
which takes with it all of the sunlight that <i>makes</i> the rainbow;
without one drop of the storm from which that bow
is reflected. Perhaps the young <span class="smcap">WIFE</span> sits solitary in the
chamber which affection has blessed, and pines amid the
thousand emblems of the taste or customs of the dead&mdash;perhaps
her grief is her inspiration, and she gives to story
or to song the promptings of her sorrow, which the world
supposes is the gift of joyous inspiration.</p>

<p>Perhaps the <i>mother</i> is pausing in the midst of renewed
anguish for the departure of her gifted, her only child, and
sits enumerating all his perfections, the greatest of which,
and that which sanctified all other virtues, and hid the very
shadowings of error, was his deep, constant love for her.
Oh, how the maternal heart, smitten by the heaviest of
griefs, bathes itself in the fountain of filial love; and when,
at last, the over-wrought frame yields to the undermining
sorrow, the mourner comforts herself with the reflection of
the afflicted monarch of Israel, "I shall go unto him, he
shall not come again unto me." These reflections, with
all of blighted hopes which parent, lover, friend and
patriot have indulged, the falling leaves of autumn suggest;
but the evergreen tells us of the survival of affections, of
friends, of beauty, and, perhaps, of attainments, and teaches
us that while we bend, and may bend in bitter anguish&mdash;anguish
long indulged beneath the rod of affliction&mdash;it is
good for us also to kiss the rod&mdash;for it has the power of
budding anew in the hand of Him who wields it; and the
same might which made it the instrument of His afflictive
dealings can make it also the means of after joy and peace.</p>

<p>Perhaps, upon the leaves that we examine, the sybil,
with rearward glance, has recorded some event for joyous
reflection. Have we not been made participants of high
gratifications&mdash;domestic, social, public associations of instructive
and pleasant operation? Have not new affections
warmed the heart, or old ones sent out new tendrils to
cling with a stronger hold upon us? Perhaps we have had
the acquisition of wealth without the augmentation of desires,
so that we can make ourselves happy by judicious
distribution. Perhaps, above all, and over all, we are
better, by the passage of the year, better by newly acquired,
and especially newly exercised virtues&mdash;virtues that
bless others, and, through them, bless ourselves. If so,
surely we have grounds for pleasant reflections on the
close of the year, and may hope that we have not lived in
vain.</p>

<p>The virtues of the human heart are like the water-springs
of the earth, their worth is measured by what overflows;
nay, as an accumulation even of the purest water must
become stagnant, profitless and offensive without an outlet,
so what we call the virtues of man become useless and
even injurious, unless they extend to others, by overflowing
the fountain breast. Virtue is communicable; and those
who associate with the good, find an influx of affection and
piety, as the woman of faith was cured by touching the
hems of the garment, that covered the source and example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of all health and goodness. If we have sought to acquire
good for ourselves, and to do good to others during the
present year, reflections upon its approaching close need
not be painful; it should be to us a source of high gratification,
that, enjoying as we have enjoyed, and mourning as
we have mourned, we are nearer the union of the good
who have gone before us, and further from the ills that
follow upon our footsteps; and as we close our year, or
close our life, may we throw back from joyous, grateful
hearts, a smile of virtuous pleasure, which shall enrich
the stern clouds that have passed us with the bow of promise
of pleasures that are to come.    C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graham's Magazine for 1849.</span>&mdash;The new volume of
Graham's Magazine, to be commenced with the January
number, will, beyond all doubt, be the most elegant
volume that has ever been issued of this most popular of
all the American monthlies. The ample experience and
liberal expenditure of money by the publishers, the ability
of its host of contributors, the editorial tact which will be
brought into service, and the genius and skill of the artists
engaged to embellish it, must more than sustain the high
position it has heretofore held in public estimation. The
magazine literature of this country is destined to a warmer
appreciation in the public regard, as it becomes purged
from the sickly sentimentality which degrades public taste,
and when the first minds in the nation are found devoting
solid thought to adorn and elevate it. A few years since,
the highest aim of contemporary competition seemed to be
to fill a given number of pages with the silly effusions of
a class of writers whose feeble powers and false taste were
gradually undermining public regard, and bringing this
branch of national literature into contempt and disgrace,
but the higher aims of the publishers of the now leading
periodicals, evinced in the engagement of the brightest intellect
of the country, have raised American periodicals
to a scale second to none in the world.</p>

<p>Blackwood and Frazer, in England, and The Knickerbocker
and "Graham's Magazine," in America, now stand
side by side, and by paying liberally for talent, command
the very highest. It may be doubted, however, whether
in this country the <i>force</i> of periodical writing has not been
in some degree impaired, by a diversion of the public eye
and taste in the smaller class of magazines with feeble
aims, to engravings and pictures, many of which are but
the refuse of the English Annuals, and the efforts of second
rate artists in this country; and also how far those magazines
which are marked by ability, and which, as magazines
of <span class="smcap">Art</span> as well as of <span class="smcap">Literature</span>, embracing in their
object and scope, the improvement of a very laudable
branch of art&mdash;that of engraving&mdash;as well as the adornment
of the work, should be drawn aside into a competition
in the <i>number</i> of their engravings, instead of the
<i>worth</i> which should mark each one of them. It appears to
us that this degrading of magazines into picture-books for
children, by impoverishing the literary department to swell
the number of wretched engravings in a department of
art, so called, must impair the value and shorten the existence
of any periodical thus conducted.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we have marked out a course in regard
to the mere illustrations of this periodical, from which we
shall not be diverted. We shall continue to furnish to our
readers the most finished and elegant specimens of the American
engraver's skill, keeping at the same time in view the
value aside from the mere <i>ornament</i> of the engraving, thus
catching the public desire in the portrait of a person who
may have some claim upon posterity, even though the face
may not be the most beautiful; and in sketches of such
scenes as deserve to live in the pages of this magazine,
either from their own great beauty, from their grandeur,
or from association which gives them value to the American
eye and mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Female Poets of America.</span>&mdash;Messrs. Lindsay &amp;
Blakiston have presented to the public a delightful volume
prepared by Caroline May. It embraces biographical
sketches, and extracts from the productions of many of our
own native female writers, and serves to render us familiar
with those whose sweet strains have often charmed our
hearts. The style of execution of the volume in question,
corresponds with the excellent character of its contents,
and the authoress, publishers and printers have executed
their respective parts with great skill and effect.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Burns, as a Poet and as a Man.</span>&mdash;The admirers of the
gifted Scottish bard, will find an interesting and well
executed review of his character as a Poet and a Man,
in a volume, prepared by S. Tyler, Esq., of the Maryland

We are indebted for a copy to Messrs. Lindsay &amp; Blakiston,
of this city, who are ever skillful in catering for the intellectual
taste of their literary friends.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><img src="images/hand.jpg" alt="hand" /> We lay our present number before our readers
with feelings of pride and pleasure, confident of the admission,
on their part, that a richer or more varied treat
has never been presented in the pages of any magazine.
Our contributors have supplied us with admirable articles&mdash;our
artists have acquitted themselves with great ability&mdash;our
printers have acted well their part&mdash;and now, we
trust, our patrons will complete our gratification, by being
as much pleased with the number before them as we are
in making the offering.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><img src="images/hand.jpg" alt="hand" /> We thank our editorial brethren throughout the
country for the favorable manner in which they continue
to notice our Magazine. They do us but justice when
they say that all our efforts will be put in exercise to keep
our Magazine in the enviable position we have so long
occupied. Always in advance of every contemporary, we
shall show in the new volume upon which we are entering,
what enterprise, zeal and energy can accomplish in the
elevation of the standard of literature and the arts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lays and Ballads</span>, <i>by T. B. Read</i>.&mdash;A volume from
the pen of Mr. Read, one of the most accomplished of our

The lateness of the hour at which a copy reached us prevents
us from noticing it at present as we desire to do.
We shall therefore make it the subject of a paragraph in
a future number.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Principles of Political Economy, with some of their Applications
to Social Philosophy. By John Stuart Mill.
Boston: Little &amp; Brown. 2 vols. 8vo.</i></p></div>

<p>Mr. Mill is almost the model man of science of his age. To
habits of deep and thorough investigation, and rigid, penetrating,
exhaustive thought&mdash;pursuing a principle through
all the details of its application, and never stopping halfway
to pause or digress&mdash;he adds a calm but strong sympathy
with the philanthropic movements of the age; and
the tendency of all his writings is to advance the cause
of truth, justice and benevolence. But he is a reformer in
a peculiar sense, not practically understood by many who
bear the name. A comprehensive and patient thinker, and
discussing every question bearing on the interest, happiness
and elevation of mankind with a conscientious as
well as rigid logic, he indulges in no vituperation, uses
none of the weapons of passion and malice, and irresistibly
conveys the impression to the most prejudiced mind that it is
truth he is seeking, not the gratification of vanity or antipathy.
The consequence is that he is the only radical thinker
in England who is read by all parties, and who influences
all parties. With more industry, mental vigor and scientific
precision than Mackintosh, he has a great deal of that beneficence
of spirit, that judicial comprehension, and that strict
impartiality of understanding, which enabled Mackintosh to
reach minds separated from his by the walls of sect and faction.
Mill is one of those rare men who make no distinction
between moral and logical honesty; who would as much
disdain to utter a sophism as to tell a lie; and who can discuss
questions which array the passions of a nation on different
sides, without adopting any of the opposite bigotries
with which they are usually connected. As a matter of
course the prejudiced and the bigoted themselves, in those
hours of calmness when they really desire to know the truth
and reason of the things they are quarreling about, go to a
man like him with perfect confidence. Thus Mill, a philosophical
English radical, is ever treated with that respect
which clings to a profound and conscientious thinker, even
by the most violent of his Tory opponents. One of the late
numbers of Blackwood's Magazine&mdash;a periodical accustomed
to blackguard the men it cannot answer, and in
which Mackintosh himself was ever treated with coarse
invective or affected contempt&mdash;has a long article on Mill's
present work on political economy, admitting its claim to
be considered one of the greatest works of the century,
even though it takes strong ground against many of the
cherished absurdities of the Tory political creed.</p>

<p>The reputation of Mr. Mill was sufficiently established
before his political economy was published. As the writer,
over the signature of A., of several articles in the Westminster
Review, such as those on Coleridge, Bentham,
and the Privileged Classes, and the author of the profoundest
and most complete treatise on Logic ever written,
he needed no introduction to the public. "The Principles
of Political Economy" is a book bearing on every page
the decisive marks of his strong and accurate mind. It is
a work after the model of Smith's Wealth of Nations, in
which principles are always associated with their applications,
and economical questions considered in their relations
to social philosophy, and the general well-being of
man. As, since the time of Adam Smith, political economy
and social philosophy have both made a perceptible advance,
Mr. Mill's work purports to supply the deficiency
of a complete system of political economy, including all
the latest discoveries, and combining a strict scientific exposition
of the abstract principles of the subject with their
practical applications. The result is that he has produced the
most complete and satisfactory work of the kind at present
in existence, and, on the whole, the most important contribution
to political economy since the time of Adam
Smith.</p>

<p>We, of course, have no space to refer at any length to
his treatment of the different branches of his subject; but
the book has one characteristic which we hope will have
the effect to make it generally read. The style is so clear,
vigorous, simple and lucid, and the illustrations so apt
and copious, that the work can be readily understood by
those readers who are commonly repelled by the dry and
abstract character of other treatises on the science. The
author intended that his book should be popular as well as
profound, and has exerted his full strength of mind in
simplifying the more abstruse principles of his subject;
and we trust that his labor will not have been spent in
vain. Every legislator, merchant, manufacturer, and
agriculturist, every man who is in any way connected
with the creation or distribution of wealth, should read
this book.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>An Oration Delivered Before the Society of Phi Beta Kappa,
at Cambridge, August 24, 1848. By Horace Bushnell.
Cambridge: George Nichols.</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. Bushnell has within a year or two taken a prominent
position among New England divines, and promises
to rank high among the influencing minds of the day.
To deep and scholarly culture, he unites a strong, independent,
and singularly keen and ingenious intellect, and
a beautiful and bountiful spirit of cheerfulness and charity.
The present oration is a fine poem, expressing rather a
mood of mind than a system of philosophy, but grouping
together with fine art many facts of consciousness, and
applying them to the phenomena of life. Every thing, in
fact, is surveyed in the light of two ideas, Work and Play,
and though the application is sometimes more fanciful than
reasonable, the result is a series of beautiful representations,
original in conception and finely felicitous in expression.
There is room for considerable difference of opinion
in the oration, but none will be inclined to doubt the
author's ability or keenness. As a specimen of the style
we extract a passage relating to war, which he calls
an imposing and plausible counterfeit of play, or inspiration.</p>

<p>"Since," he says, "we cannot stay content in the dull
uninspired world of economy and work, we are as ready
to see a hero as he is to be one. Nay, we must have our
heroes, as I just said, and we are ready to harness ourselves,
by the million, to any man who will let us fight
him out the name. Thus we find out occasions for war&mdash;wrongs
to be redressed, revenges to be taken, such as we
may feign inspiration and play the great heart under. We
collect armies, and dress up leaders in gold and high colors,
meaning by the brave look, to inspire some notion of a
hero beforehand. Then we set the men in phalanxes and
squadrons, where the personality itself is taken away, and
a vast impersonal person called an army, a magnanimous
and brave monster, is all that remains. The masses of
fierce color, the glitter of the steel, the dancing plumes, the
waving flags, the deep throb of the music lifting every foot&mdash;under
these the living acres of men, possessed by the
one thought of playing brave to-day, are rolled on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
battle. Thunder, fire, dust, blood, groans&mdash;what of these?&mdash;nobody
thinks of these, for nobody dares to think till the
day is over, and then the world rejoices to behold a new
batch of heroes."</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Three Sisters and Three Fortunes; or Rose, Blanche and
Violet. By G. H. Lewes. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</i></p></div>

<p>Mr. Lewes is an author very little known in this country.
This is the first work of his which has been reprinted.
But in England he has considerable reputation among the
higher class of readers and men of taste for his brilliant
powers of mind and extensive acquirements. His Biographical
History of Philosophy we have never seen, but
we have observed allusions to it in other publications,
exalting it to a very high rank among thoughtful books.
For some time, if we are not mistaken, he was the chief
literary critic of the Westminster Review, and many of
his articles were marked by strong and deep thinking, a
little injured by vagaries of expression. In a novel by
such a writer we should naturally expect more than a
mere love story, more than a narrative of incidents and
representation of passions; and he has not disappointed expectation.
Indeed one can easily see that the book is
based on a philosophical system, and that more is meant
than directly meets the eye. The characters and events
all illustrate some problems in metaphysics and ethics, and
refer more to the understanding than the imagination.
The story does not lack interest, nor the personages character,
but both are o'erinformed with meditation. Fine
as the novel undoubtedly is, the author has not given it the
requisite artistical finish to produce an harmonious impression.
Speculation on matters connected with literature,
art and politics, essays on the passions and the will,
appear in their naked character amid romantic incidents
and imaginative representation. The author, in short,
ought to have made his book altogether didactic or altogether
dramatic, to fulfill the requisitions of either department.
Had he fused all his abstract thought and practical
speculation in the alembic of the imagination, and accordingly
represented all in the concrete form of character
and events, the result would have been a much better
novel.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Euthanasy; or Happy Talk Toward the End of Life. By
William Mountford, Author of Martyria, &amp;c., &amp;c. Boston:
Crosby &amp; Nichols. 1 vol. 12mo.</i></p></div>

<p>The author of this volume is one of the most profoundly
meditative writers living. We are not aware that his
productions have had an extended circulation out of New
England, where they are very popular, and if they have
not, we hardly know of a better service we could do our
readers than to advise them to seek his companionship.
Martyria and the present work are two books which no
one can read without being benefitted&mdash;without having a
deeper sense of the "dread soul within him," and without
feeling a warmer love of his race. "Euthanasy" is one
of those volumes which win their way into the heart with
a soft unconscious persuasiveness, and abide there when
they have once found an entrance. The author's spirit is
rich, sweet, thoughtful, tender&mdash;seeking the beautiful and
the good by a spontaneous instinct, and discerning them
often, with the subtilty of purity in things which seem
valueless to the common eye&mdash;and while it soars into the
highest regions of spiritual contemplation, can still survey
practical life with a wisdom and sagacity which almost
seem incompatible with its loftiness. The truth is that
the author possesses one of the rarest things ever seen
in this world&mdash;a truly spiritual mind, in which there is
established no divorce between the practical and the
spiritual, the common and the ideal. Spirituality with him
is a life&mdash;no hearsay or imagination, but an experience.
He consequently spiritualizes the human and humanizes
the spiritual.</p>

<p>The work, in addition to its own stores of original
thought, has many a golden sentence and rhyme from
the meditative poets of Germany and England, which
lend it increased richness and beauty.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ellen Middleton; a Tale. By Lady Georgiana Fullerton,
Author of Grantly Manor. New York: D. Appleton
&amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</i></p></div>

<p>Grantly Manor is a novel of high and peculiar excellence,
and has had a great run. Its readers threw themselves
upon the present work as soon as it was published,
their expectations whetted by the memory of the last.
The result has been comparative disappointment. The
truth is Ellen Middleton preceded Grantly Manor, and is
altogether a less pleasing production. Considered, however,
as the first work of the author, it is rich in promise and
by no means insignificant in performance. The characters
are strongly drawn and well discriminated, and the
passions with which it deals are of that potent kind which
test a novelist's strength and daring. The difficulty with
the book is not its lack of power, but its lack of homely
interest. The characters and incidents are too much made
up in the author's mind&mdash;enclosed, as it were, in a peculiar
domain, and colored by one peculiar experience of life&mdash;to
give that satisfaction which results from a delineation
of actual life, or from vivid and beautiful ideal creations.
There is too much agony, and anguish, and hyperbolical
emotion, and splitting of the heart, and such like rioting
in spiritual misery and ruin. The elegance, eloquence
and sweetness of the author's style, and the high moral
and religious character of her mind, appear, however, in
Ellen Middleton as in Grantly Manor, and with the advantage
of as good a story would produce as agreeable an
impression.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>History of Mary, Queen of Scotts. By Jacob Abbott. With
Engravings. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol.
16mo.</i></p></div>

<p>This is one of a series of popular histories which Mr.
Abbott is preparing for his countrymen. The tone and
object will considerably differ from the common historical
works in circulation. Mr. Abbott considers that
the situation and principles of American readers require
views of historical events different from those they would
obtain from foreigners. The present work is devoted to
one of the most romantic and thrilling stories in historical
literature&mdash;the Life of Mary, Queen of Scotts. It is
elegantly and truthfully written, and the mechanical execution
of the volume is exceedingly beautiful.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Macaulay's History of England.</i></p></div>

<p>The Harpers have received from the author, in sheets,
the first and second volumes of "The History of England,
from the Accession of James II., by T. B. Macaulay."
For these they pay one hundred guineas a volume. The
work itself will doubtless create as great a stir as any book
published within the last twenty years. Every body is
curious especially to discover the style which Macaulay has
adopted&mdash;that of his Essays being too brisk, brilliant and
epigrammatic for an historian. It will probably be something
like that of the Preface to the "Lays of Ancient
Rome," or that of his latest article on Lord Chatham.</p>
